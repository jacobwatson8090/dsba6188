            "Xcel Energy achieved strong financial and operational results again in 2021, despite the second year of a global pandemic and severe weather challenges. During these tough times, we delivered for our customers and communities when they needed us most, and we continued to advance our financial, operational, and sustainability goals. Our theme for this report, “Horizon Bound,” reflects our balanced, organic growth and our aggressive clean energy targets for the next decade and beyond. In the next eight years, we will add significant renewable generation to our system, expand our transmission infrastructure to enable those resources, deploy new clean fuels to power our customers and heat their homes, invest in grid resiliency and automation, and enable electrification of transportation at scale, all while keeping customer bills affordable. This report showcases how our team is working hard to deliver for you, our valued shareholders. CEO transition It was an honor to be elected by our Board of Directors to replace retiring Ben Fowke as our company’s CEO in August. I worked closely with Ben for five years, first as Chief Financial Officer and more recently as President and Chief Operating Officer. We share the same vision for the company and executed our transition in August from a position of strength — our reputation is excellent, our balance sheet is healthy, our operations are strong, and our strategy is sound. Solid financial performance For the 17th consecutive year, we met or exceeded our earnings guidance, and we increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We delivered earnings of $2.96 per share, within the upper half of our initial guidance range. We increased our dividend 6.4%, or 11 cents per share in 2021, which is in line with our 5% to 7% goal. Our stock continues to trade at a premium and has outperformed our peer group for the three-, five- and ten-year periods. Our robust five-year, $26 billion capital investment plan will provide significant customer value and drive regulated rate base growth of 6.5%. And, we’ve identified additional investment opportunities in that timeframe for an incremental capital investment of $1.5 to $2.5 billion, which would increase our growth rate to 7.4%. Clean energy leadership In November, we announced a clean energy vision for our natural gas distribution business. Our vision reduces greenhouse gas emissions 25% from 2020 levels by 2030, including netzero methane emissions from our distribution system, and delivers net-zero natural gas service to customers by 2050. (See story on page 14). Our natural gas vision builds on our previously announced electric goals for reducing carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and producing 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We also plan to use our increasingly clean product to power 1.5 million electric vehicles in our states by the end of the decade, resulting in additional carbon reduction, future sales growth, and customer fuel savings. Together, these commitments represent a comprehensive clean energy vision, making Xcel Energy the first U.S. energy provider to set aggressive clean energy goals across all the ways our customers use energy: electricity, transportation, and heating. And we are well on our way to achieving that vision. Delivering at critical times We never take for granted the trust we have earned to power millions of homes and businesses all day, every day, particularly during extreme weather. In 2021, there were two significant events that impacted our service territory — Winter Storm Uri in Texas and the Marshall Wildfire in Colorado. These two natural disasters challenged our teams to deliver in the most arduous conditions. And as always, we rose to the challenge. Historic cold temperatures during Winter Storm Uri froze natural gas wells throughout Texas and Oklahoma, creating natural gas supply constraints and price spikes across the country. At the same time, the Texas electric system saw generation equipment failures caused by the cold, which left millions without power or heat. Our plants and equipment in the Southwest are winterized for extreme temperatures and performed very well during the event, despite widespread failures of other generating assets. Despite our employees operating our gas distribution system extremely capably during the 10-day record-setting cold period, we were not immune from the sudden, extraordinary increase in natural gas prices that went along with Winter Storm Uri. We incurred $925 million of additional fuel costs that we are working with regulators to recover while helping customers manage costs. Following a particularly dry fourth quarter, on Dec. 30, Colorado faced an intense windstorm that packed 110 mph winds and fueled the devastating Marshall Wildfire. The Boulder County fires destroyed more than 1,200 homes and businesses in the area, and partially or totally destroyed the homes of 17 of our own employees. Hundreds of employees, contractors and mutual aid crews were on the scene as soon as it was safe and worked around the clock to get service restored to the impacted communities. These extreme weather events reinforce the need for continued investment in system resiliency, such as our approved wildfire mitigation program, to protect communities from the growing impacts of climate change. Constructive regulatory outcomes We reached constructive rate case settlements in six states last year. In Colorado, we also reached constructive settlements for Winter Storm Uri cost recovery, our electric resource plan and our Power Pathway transmission project, a nearly $2 billion investment necessary to enable future renewable generation assets. The New Mexico commission approved our Transportation Electrification Plan, and we launched several commercial and residential programs to support electric vehicle adoption in Colorado as part of our approved, industryleading Transportation Electrification Plan. (See story on pages 10-11). In February 2022, the New Mexico commission also approved our electric rate case settlement. Also in February 2022, the company received approval for its Upper Midwest Generation Resource Plan, including a full closure of all coal plants in the region by 2030, over 85% carbon reduction, 5,750 megawatts of new wind and solar assets, and transmission infrastructure to enable those resources. The plan also includes a license extension of our Monticello nuclear plant through 2040. Our proposed resource plan in Colorado would add 5,100 megawatts of new renewable generation assets and is expected to reduce carbon emissions 87% by 2030. (See story on pages 8-9). Renewable energy expansion Our Steel for Fuel strategy — building and owning wind farms that deliver economic and environmental benefits for our customers — continues to drive organic growth, provide an attractive shareholder return, and save customers money. Since 2017, wind energy — through a combination of fuel savings and tax credits — saved customers an estimated $1.8 billion. We now have over 11,000 megawatts of total wind capacity, including nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind. We also advanced plans for owning our first large-scale solar projects. We received approval for a 74-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin and proposed a 460-megawatt project near our Sherco coal plant in Minnesota. Advanced Grid Initiative Our $1.7 billion, multi-year Advanced Grid Initiative, to use advanced technology to bring customers cleaner, safer, more reliable energy, achieved a significant milestone in 2021 as the first batch of 310,000 smart meters were installed in Colorado. The two-way communication capabilities will help improve reliability, reduce the time it takes to restore power during an outage, and provide customers more options to manage their energy use and save money. (See story on pages 6-7). Operational excellence Operational excellence is at the core of our commitment and approach to operating our plants and facilities and our preparedness to respond to extreme weather and other events. We remain the top-performing nuclear fleet in the country. One of our units at Prairie Island operated for a record 703 consecutive days before its scheduled refueling in October. Additionally, we have held our operating and maintenance costs flat since 2013, helping to keep customer bills low without compromising safety or reliability. We remain committed to our industry-leading “Safety Always” program. (See story on pages 12-13). Employee focus As we have done since the start of the pandemic, our employees continue to follow extra safety protocols to protect themselves, their coworkers, and their loved ones from COVID-19. Approximately half of our employees worked remotely in 2021 but are returning to the office this spring with a hybrid work schedule as the pandemic continues to recede. The company added diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) metrics to its corporate scorecard for the first time in 2021, and I am pleased to report that we exceeded our goals. Diversity and inclusion make us a stronger company and a more welcoming workplace, where we can attract and retain top talent. (See story on page 2). It’s an honor to lead this team — more than 11,000 employees strong — that is consistently recognized with its outstanding business practices and ethics, operational performance, veteran hiring, and workplace culture. We were honored to be named among the World’s Most Ethical Companies® by Ethisphere for the third consecutive year, reflecting the company’s commitment to sustainability and ethical business practices. We also were among the Human Rights Campaign’s Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality, earning a perfect score on its Corporate Equality Index for the sixth consecutive year. We were named one of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies for the ninth consecutive year and ranked second among energy providers. With the best employees in the industry serving you, I’m excited about the future — not just what’s in store for 2022, but for the transformative progress on the horizon. You can count on the Xcel Energy team to deliver for you. Thanks for the continued trust you place in us. \n",

            "In 2019, we made significant progress in advancing our strategy to redefine what power can be in the lives of our customers. We are building a customer-focused organization that empowers consumers with personalized energy choices while also providing meaningful long-term value to our shareholders, employees, and communities. We rightsized our business, and now we have shifted our focus to perfecting our integrated business model. I’d like to share with you our key achievements from 2019 and provide a look ahead at our 2020 focus.\n",
            "\n",
            "A solid performance always starts with the well-being of our people and 2019 was no different. Thanks to the continuous efforts of our employees, we achieved top-decile safety performance and our best year on record. We further perfected and grew our integrated business by acquiring Stream Energy, a retailer that expanded our sales channels and product offering, and we successfully brought online the Gregory gas plant in Texas ahead of the important summer months. From a financial standpoint, our balance sheet has never been stronger, having achieved our credit metric targets and we are now on a path for investment-grade rating. We also provided additional clarity on our long-term capital allocation philosophy including a 10x increase on our dividend. We are committing 50% of our allocation to growth opportunities and 50% to be returned to our shareholders through a mix of our dividend and share repurchases. \n",
            "\n",
            "While our solid operational and financial performance underpins our success, our comprehensive sustainability program provides a framework to ensure long-term value creation for all stakeholders. In 2019, we were awarded leadership level for CDP programs on climate risk, water security and supply chain engagement.  We also announced the acceleration of our carbon reduction goals aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5⁰ C to avoid the worst effects of climate change. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and achieving net-zero by 2050, from our 2014 baseline. These industry-leading decarbonization efforts move us further down the path of transitioning our business away from traditional fossil-generation and closer to our customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our sustainability framework extends throughout our workforce and into the communities where we live and work. We’ve elevated the importance of Diversity & Inclusion to become one of our core corporate values and have expanded safety to encompass overall well-being. I am also very proud of how our employees carry our spirit of philanthropy into our communities, donating to nearly 700 organizations and serving more than 11,000 volunteer hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "We believe that one-size-fits-all electricity is no longer compatible with today’s low carbon, digital and customized economy. Customers deserve to have choices that meet their needs and align with their values. We are working hard in creating these personal and compelling products and services.  For example, as demand for renewable energy grows, we are providing medium-term contracts to developers for approximately 1.6 gigawatts of new solar projects throughout Texas to bring online cleaner generation capacity.  Additionally, the electrification of transportation is critical for economy-wide decarbonization and as such, we became a founding member of the City of Houston’s EVolve coalition, a public-private partnership aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.  To ensure all our customers can enjoy these products and services, we strongly advocate for market structures and policies that promote competition, incorporate new technologies and unlock value for consumers.\n",

            "I am proud of the progress we’ve made since we shifted the strategic direction of the company at the end of 2015. We have demonstrated discipline on execution and foresight on our strategy. The power sector is evolving, becoming cleaner, smarter and more connected than ever before. We have never been stronger or better positioned to capitalize on this energy transition and create significant value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for your support these past four years; we are just getting started.\n",

            "Dear fellow shareholders: Over the last two years, we have seen the world undergo changes at a scale unseen in more than a century. The global pandemic has changed the nature of how we lead our lives and redefined the meaning of health and safety for each of us. The recent crisis in Ukraine is also disturbing and unsettling and creates a sense of profound sadness for everyone. As we reassess almost every aspect of our lives, we are also seeking new opportunities, striving to find a greater sense of balance at home and at work, and ultimately envisioning a new normal — namely a world with greater peace and stability. The extraordinary changes we have experienced over the last two years also spurred a dramatic shift in business perspectives — both for our company and the overall energy industry. I want to share what we are doing at Sempra to be a leader in today’s dynamic world and how the changes we are experiencing underscore the critical role that energy infrastructure plays in supporting economic growth here in North America and abroad. I also want to reinforce how these changes underpin our core strategies, including elevating our focus on sustainable business practices, growing investments in new technologies, and maintaining our emphasis on strong capital discipline — all with a view toward delivering greater value to our company’s shareholders. At Sempra, this past year also provided an opportunity to look forward with greater clarity and passion to our Leading 2025 strategy — our strategic initiative to drive sustained performance and long-term value for all our stakeholders in the communities we serve. The unprecedented global focus on climate change has compelled companies and countries to recommit themselves to a cleaner, safer and healthier planet. It is no longer enough for businesses to simply serve customers well. We must demonstrate genuine progress and accountability in everything we do to advance more sustainable business practices. The central purpose of our company is to play a critical role in building the 21st century energy networks to advance electrification and promote energy diversification, resiliency, and affordable access to cleaner forms of energy. But to be clear, our goal is not to just be a participant in this transition to a cleaner energy system — we are committed to help lead it. As we look ahead, we fully expect the speed of change to accelerate. We believe global energy markets are going to evolve dramatically over the next 30 years — with energy investments centering on cleaner forms of electrification and decarbonization strategies across all sectors of the economy. Against the background of this shifting energy landscape, we are well-positioned to attract significant investment opportunities through our three integrated growth platforms: Sempra California, Sempra Texas and Sempra Infrastructure. We are committed to finding new and better ways to serve our customers, with a near-term focus on four critical success factors: • Sustainability as the centerpiece of our corporate strategy • Leadership in technology and innovation • Financial strength to deliver across different market cycles • Energy diversification to capture new opportunities Leading 2025 Sustainability Is Core to Our Strategy Centering our corporate strategy around sustainable business practices brings a sharper focus on the new and emerging role of energy networks in meeting the competing demands of energy security, future economic growth, and the development of a lower-carbon society. Today, we are investing in critical new infrastructure to expand electrification in the markets we serve. We believe doing so supports moving cleaner sources of energy onto the grid and is an essential part of powering new solutions to society’s climate challenges, as well as building a healthy economy and better quality of life for our communities. Building a carbon-neutral society requires new ways of thinking, collaboration and innovation, as well as disciplined decision making. For example, when making decisions around capital allocation, we focus on investing in assets that we believe should produce good and prudent returns and further de-risk our portfolio while also contributing to sustainable business practices. In fact, in our Sustainable Financing Framework, published in 2021, we outline the parameters under which we can finance sustainable projects that are aligned with our business and environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy. Sempra’s Sustainable Financing Framework further demonstrates our role in shaping a sustainable future and paving the way for future ESG financing opportunities. Likewise, we are focused on responsible energy solutions as we build more resilient energy grids that are adaptable to a changing environment. For two decades, the Sempra family of companies has been on a deliberate path to decarbonize our business operations as well as the markets we serve. Our U.S. utility companies are investing in hydrogen technology, renewable natural gas and electric vehicle infrastructure, while also integrating more renewables onto the grid. Our North American energy infrastructure includes a growing portfolio of clean energy development projects designed to improve safety and help ensure greater reliability of our services. In addition, our liquified natural gas facilities help reduce reliance on oil in electricity production in Mexico, while also supporting global markets that are transitioning away from coal and oil to lower carbon energy options like natural gas. Leadership in Technology and Innovation As our company grows, technology will increasingly play a critical role in improving the overall quality and affordability of our services. Our Leading 2025 initiative includes investing in strategic research and development opportunities, cutting-edge digital service platforms, and enhanced cybersecurity programs, to fortify safety and reliability. A leading indicator of digital transformation success can be measured by an organization’s ability to build and harness the predictive and analytical power of data for the benefit of its customers. That is why we are digitizing our business activities to improve the safe and reliable delivery of cleaner and more intermittent energy sources, while also lowering the cost of our services. At our Sempra California platform, where we serve close to 26 million customers, we are rolling out next-generation technologies to deliver world class safety and operational efficiencies. Like other sectors, our utilities are looking to digitize their end-to-end operations from energy delivery to supply chain management so they can rapidly adapt to changing market dynamics. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) is a recognized market leader in wildfire safety and climate resilience, the adoption of smart-grid technologies and the integration of advanced energy storage. Moreover, the company has pioneered zero-emissions microgrids, artificial intelligence models for weather forecasting and vegetation management, drone inspections of electric infrastructure and longer-duration flow batteries. Similarly, Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) is on the cutting edge of clean energy technology, operational safety and energy efficiency. The company was the first gas utility in the nation to install an advanced meter system that captures hourly gas consumption information from our customers and introduce renewable natural gas from landfill waste into the gas system. Additionally, SoCalGas is a recognized industry leader in hydrogen projects with the country’s first power-to-hydrogen gas demonstration project. Today, SoCalGas is testing the blending of hydrogen into natural gas pipelines as the company works to help build the foundation for California’s future hydrogen economy. Within Sempra Texas, Oncor Electric Delivery Co. LLC (Oncor), which operates the state’s largest transmission and distribution (T&D) system, is committed to developing and harnessing new technologies. The company has invested billions in infrastructure advancements to create a state of-the-art power grid to deliver safe, reliable energy to nearly 13 million Texans. By leveraging the power of predictive analytics, the Oncor grid can identify, monitor and resolve interruptions before they happen. Sempra Infrastructure is also at the forefront of energy innovation. The company is developing one of the world’s first carbon sequestration hubs that would not only advance decarbonization of its own infrastructure, but also has the potential to do that for other industrial facilities along the Gulf Coast region. Sempra Infrastructure is also exploring new, smart cross-border infrastructure to advance clean power and energy networks. Financial Strength At Sempra, we have consistently delivered value to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation approach supports our financial goals and remains centered on our commitment to investing in safety, reliability and other ESG priorities. One of the roles of the capital markets is to pull future risk forward — and that is why we are constantly reassessing how we allocate capital to create the most value for our owners. This also informs our core financial strategy, which narrowly targets investments in critical T&D infrastructure in highly attractive markets where we have improved visibility into earnings with reduced financial, commodity and operating risks. We are committed to building a top-tier T&D infrastructure platform, executing on our robust capital plan, growing our earnings and cash flows and continuing to protect the strength of our balance sheet. With our utilities strategically located in leading markets in North America — including California, the fifth-largest economy in the world, and Texas, the fastest-growing state in the U.S. and ninth-largest economy in the world — we see a portfolio of exciting opportunities for future growth. Energy Diversification In 2020, we completed our multi-year capital rotation program, narrowing Sempra’s focus to strategic markets in North America with attractive fundamentals. We continue to target T&D-like investments that are expected to carry higher value and lower risk as a result of regulated rates of return and long-term contracted cash flows. Thus, we now have several strategic advantages that enable us to hold a top-tier position in some of the leading markets in North America: • We operate in some of the largest economies in the world — California has the highest gross domestic product in North America; Texas is second and Mexico is fifth. • We operate T&D infrastructure that provides access to world-class solar and wind resources, powering some of North America’s leading energy-producing basins and reliably serving some of North America’s largest ports. We own 11 of 25 U.S.-Mexico cross-border pipeline interconnections, which exported a record amount of natural gas from the U.S. to Mexico in 2021. • Our cross-border transmission capacity connects U.S. markets to some of the leading solar and wind resources in Northern Mexico. Importantly, 2021 marked the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, combining two world class infrastructure businesses into a single platform positioned to capture new opportunities to support the continued integration of North American energy markets. Focused on delivering energy for a better world, the company is already connecting customers across the globe to cleaner energy technologies and more modern infrastructure. The newly combined platform further simplifies our business model, improves scale, and creates an investment-grade balance sheet that allows Sempra Infrastructure to self fund its growth. High-Performance Culture Our mission is to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company, an endeavor which would not be possible without our employees. Our 20,000 employees have risen time and time again to the challenges of the pandemic, while staying focused on serving our communities safely and delivering energy with purpose. Our employees display excellence and dependability and continuously make significant contributions to our success. I am privileged to work with so many extraordinary people and truly believe that we have the most talented workforce in the industry. The key tenets of our high-performance culture include an unwavering focus on safety in everything we do, a commitment to leadership and employee development, and a continued dedication to advancing diverse perspectives while creating an inclusive environment for our workforce and communities. Safety is foundational and differentiates us from our peers — as evidenced by our strong wildfire mitigation program here in California, as well as our recent exceptional safety records at Cameron LNG Phase 1 and ECA LNG Phase 1. This past year, we also increased transparency around diversity and inclusion by sharing diversity statistics across our enterprise. We believe we are a stronger company when every employee feels empowered to bring their best selves to work, and we are continuously evaluating how we can create a true sense of belonging for all our employees and communities. We encourage our employees to be service oriented and to use our values as their guidepost: • Do the right thing • Champion people • Shape the future Our culture is central to our success in bringing stakeholders together in support of delivering long term, sustainable value for our shareholders — and improves our competitive position as we look ahead. Embarking on a new year, we are clear-eyed about the very real challenges facing us — and the need to thoughtfully help lead a just and orderly energy transition for our customers, our industry and our society. At Sempra, we will not be deterred by the obstacles we may encounter. Instead, we are 20,000 strong who embrace a common purpose and understand that the most challenging path is often the most rewarding. And that is the path we have chosen. The opportunities ahead of us are cause for excitement, unify our endeavors, and strongly influence our optimism for the future. On behalf of my Sempra colleagues, thank you for placing your confidence in us and investing in Sempra. Boldly forward together,\n",

            "2020 was a year of extreme volatility for our industry and the world, as the COVID-19 pandemic and a commodity price war led to unprecedented challenges. Amid these difficulties, Occidental continued to make meaningful progress to strengthen our balance sheet and position our company for the future. As a best-inclass, low-cost operator, we apply technology to drive performance and leverage our global leadership in carbon management to advance our business. We believe our core differentiators—an industry-leading portfolio, track record of operational excellence and efficiency, and strategy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—enable us to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Occidental transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position due to achieving our 2020 divestiture target, reducing debt by $2.4 billion and successfully extending $7 billion in debt maturities to 2025 and beyond. We significantly lowered capital spending and implemented substantial operating and corporate cost reductions. Our 2021 capital budget prioritizes free cash flow and our high-quality asset base provides flexibility to adjust activity and capital allocations. There is much work ahead, but we are confident the steps we are taking will make us stronger and more competitive. As one of the largest oil producers in the U.S., we hold a leading position in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg Basins and offshore Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are the largest independent oil producer in Oman, have leading positions in the United Arab Emirates and Algeria, and hold highly prospective exploration blocks offshore Colombia. Our midstream and marketing segment complements our upstream operations, providing an integrated business from point of production to point of sale. OxyChem, our world-class chemical business, generates significant free cash flow with growth opportunities and a best-in-class safety record. Our Oxy Low Carbon Ventures business advances leading-edge technologies and business solutions to economically grow our business while reducing emissions. Our future depends on a world with lower emissions and we recently set new targets to reduce our GHG emissions, including methane, and are on track to end routine gas flaring by 2030. I am proud we are the first U.S. energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with our operations by 2040 and the use of our products by 2050. Occidental is committed to using our global leadership and over 40 years of experience in carbon management to advance a lower-carbon world. We are a founding member of the six Energy Transition Principles, an industry-led collaboration to advance the Paris Agreement objectives, and were the first U.S. oil and gas company to endorse the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative. We are a member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a group of leading global energy companies accelerating our sector’s response to climate change. Safety is integral to our company, and we had our bestever safety performance in 2020. We were pleased to be ranked among Fortune’s Most Admired Companies’ Mining, Crude-Oil Production category in 2021. Occidental has made the list every reported year since 2008, including the No. 1 ranking 11 times. Our Board of Directors is committed to strong corporate governance and board refreshment to ensure diverse leadership experience. Steve Chazen, our former CEO, has joined the Board as Chairman, and we have added four new independent directors. The Board created the Sustainability and Shareholder Engagement Committee to enhance proactive outreach with key stakeholders. The Board is also a driving force behind our commitment to promote diversity, inclusion and a culture of belonging, all of which I strongly believe are critical to our future success. We recently celebrated Occidental’s centennial. Our first century’s achievements reflect our technical expertise, ability to adapt quickly and ceaseless drive to lead with innovation. These same attributes, combined with our talented workforce, laser focus on efficiency, and unique and defining approach to sustainability in a low-carbon world, will ensure our leadership over the next 100 years.\n",

            "As 2021 came to a close, we concluded our three-year strategic plan to transform the company into a more innovative and efficient railroad. As part of this strategy, we deployed our own brand of precision scheduled railroading principles through our TOP21 operating plan. With tremendous dedication from the entire team, we delivered on our commitments in spite of significant headwinds associated with a freight recession and a global pandemic. Over the last three years, Norfolk Southern has reduced our operating ratio by 530 basis points and achieved a company record of 60.1%. We’ve reached record productivity levels across our operations, improving average train weight and length 21% and 20%, respectively. Since beginning the strategic plan, earnings per share grew 27%, and we returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During this time, our company led the industry in total shareholder returns with growth of 110%. We achieved strong financial results in 2021. Our company grew revenue 14%, outpacing a 6% increase in adjusted operating expenses driven largely by rising fuel costs.1 We achieved net income of $3 billion, a 27% increase, while earnings per share increased 31%, compared to the adjusted prior year amounts.1 In addition, we accomplished record highs in operating income and free cash flow.2 Each of our markets experienced volume and revenue growth in 2021, reflecting a resurgent economy and strong demand for our service product. Both our merchandise and intermodal markets grew by over half a billion dollars in 2021, as markets benefitted from higher demand, elevated consumer activity, and favorable pricing conditions. Coal revenue was bolstered by higher export prices and growth in steel production. While our focus on productivity and revenue growth produced record financial results, our service – impacted by labor shortages across key areas of our network – was not where it needed to be. Accordingly, we have increased our hiring and retention efforts, and begun development of a new operating plan that is fully aligned around a return to the service levels our customers expect. SETTING THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY Helping shippers reduce their carbon footprint is one of our industry’s competitive advantages, and Norfolk Southern made substantial sustainability gains in 2021. We set a science-based target to reduce our carbon emissions, aligning our commitment to combat climate change with the Paris Climate Accords. Consistent with our goal, we also became the first North American Class I railroad to issue green bonds to finance projects that generate environmental benefits. Sustainable business practices are increasingly important to our customers as well, and many have set their own public goals for carbon reduction. Norfolk Southern is partnering with these companies to deliver results. By choosing rail, our customers avoid 15 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually. INCREASING VALUE WITH THE DIGITAL RAILROAD OF THE FUTURE We continue to deploy innovative technology solutions to improve safety and efficiency, reduce our environmental impact, and make it easier to do business with Norfolk Southern. From artificial intelligence to automated inspections to mobile applications, we are leading the charge to build the digital railroad of the future. In 2021, we developed new resources to deliver value to our customers and the marketplace, including our first-in-class industrial site search engine, NSites. This one-stop digital tool allows users to create customized searches for some 800 rail-served industrial sites and 250 rail-truck transload facilities across our system. As manufacturers expressed a desire to redesign their supply chains with supply certainty and inventory closer to their customers, the Norfolk Southern team responded quickly with a solution to meet their unique business needs. OPENING OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN ATLANTA In November, we celebrated the ribboncutting of 650 WPT, our new home in Midtown on West Peachtree Street. Located in the heart of Atlanta’s Tech Square, the campus is ideally suited for Norfolk Southern’s innovative and collaborative team. We brought our company’s leaders – including operations, marketing, finance, and technology – together in one location to drive productivity and efficiency across our organization. The design, location, and accommodations of 650 WPT promote the health and well-being of our employees, underscoring our commitment to a safe and inclusive work environment. ENSURING A SAFE, INCLUSIVE, AND ACCOUNTABLE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE For Norfolk Southern to reach its full potential, our people must be able to thrive. With that in mind, we’re building a best-inclass employee experience. From expanded leadership development programs to ambitious Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, our team is working to align, engage, and develop our workforce. We’ve taken multiple steps to bring DEI into every aspect of our company and operations, building a representative and inclusive culture. To further drive accountability within our organization, we expanded our Inclusion Leadership Council, which includes senior leaders from every department. The Norfolk Southern team showed impressive resilience throughout the year, and produced record results despite significant challenges and uncertainty. Moving forward, our company has an optimistic and confident outlook. BUILDING LASTING RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES With operations across 22 states and Washington, D.C., Norfolk Southern has a tremendous opportunity to make a positive impact. Through our corporate giving strategy, we’re intent on cultivating lasting relationships that go beyond charitable contributions to build genuine connections through service. In 2021, in conjunction with our move from Norfolk to Atlanta, we made a $5 million investment in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, community to provide local nonprofits access to $1 million in grants over the next five years. We wanted to send a clear message that our presence in Virginia will remain strong, and is important to our company. In our new corporate hometown, we partnered with the Atlanta History Center to donate the comprehensive historical archives of our predecessor company Southern Railway. Our company played a major role in the growth of Atlanta, and we’re making this rich history accessible to scholars, students, and railfans. Norfolk Southern is providing $500,000 to support the collection in perpetuity and create paid internship opportunities for underrepresented communities for five years. DELIVERING A SMOOTH TRANSITION IN LEADERSHIP During my time as chairman and CEO of Norfolk Southern, I am proud of what we’ve accomplished. We’ve delivered industry-leading shareholder returns over the course of our latest strategic plan, become a more efficient, sustainable, and technologically innovative railroad, and brought company leadership together in a new, state-of-the-art Atlanta headquarters. We are in a rock-solid position for continued success. Alan Shaw, who was named company president in December 2021, is the right leader for the next chapter in our ongoing story of transformation. He is a veteran railroader who understands every aspect of our business, and will lead continued improvement in service and efficiency. Alan has unparalleled knowledge of our customers and the markets we serve, as well as the vision to grow shareholder value in our competitive, rapidly evolving industry. Effective May 1, Alan will assume the role of CEO and join Norfolk Southern’s board. At that time, Amy E. Miles – a director since 2014 – will become the non-executive chair of your board of directors. In the months ahead, we will continue working together to complete a smooth transition and are confident that all Norfolk Southern stakeholders will be in good hands with our new leadership. Thank you for your investment in Norfolk Southern. \n",

            "To our stockholders, The world is changing. Technology is improving. Customer expectations continue to rise. In the midst of it all, we believe that the key to enduring progress — the key to sustainable growth of our business — is our focus on the fundamentals. Every decision we make is grounded in reliability, customer satisfaction, financial discipline and environmental stewardship. And we’re pleased to report that on virtually every meaningful measure, we delivered another year of solid results in 2019. • We reported record net income from operations of $1.13 billion and earnings per share of $3.58 — exceeding our guidance for the year. • Our stock price set 48 new record highs, rising to $98.19 on Sept. 4, 2019. • Our total shareholder return was 37 percent — surpassing the performance of all the major utility indexes. • Our balance sheet grew even stronger — supporting our investment-grade credit ratings. We moved forward with our generation reshaping strategy. Our priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a system that can respond reliably and consistently — in the face of severe weather events and other emergencies. • We retired 40 percent of our coal generation since 2014. • In 2019, we met and exceeded our 2030 goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent below 2005 levels. Given our progress, we are re-evaluating our longer-term carbon reduction goals. • We set a goal, by the year 2030, to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas distribution lines by 30 percent per mile from a 2011 baseline. We are more than halfway toward meeting this goal. Our ongoing work to modernize Chicago’s natural gas delivery network is key to achieving our goal. • Between 2020 and 2024, we expect to spend nearly a billion dollars to increase the amount of renewable generation on our system. • Construction began on two of the largest solar installations in the Midwest. These utility-scale solar facilities will play an important role in producing renewable energy for our customers for many years to come. • Our utility in the Upper Peninsula provided the energy solution needed in northern Michigan. Two new natural gas-fueled plants began operating in March 2019, which enabled us to retire our less efficient, coal-fueled Presque Isle Power Plant. We strengthened the energy infrastructure our customers depend on. • We invested nearly $2.3 billion in our core business to maintain reliability and improve customer service. • In Wisconsin, where we have 70 percent of our regulated assets, we constructively settled our rate reviews. New rates for energy service went into effect Jan. 1, 2020. • We Energies, our largest utility, was named the most reliable in the Midwest for the ninth year in a row, and Wisconsin Public Service was recognized for the first time for its outstanding reliability performance as a midsize utility. • We announced plans to build two liquefied natural gas facilities to address the need for more natural gas peaking capacity in Wisconsin at the highest demand times on the coldest days. If approved, construction is expected to begin in summer 2021. We expect to invest $370 million. Opportunities to invest in energy infrastructure outside of our regulated footprint continue to help our business grow sustainably. • In recent months, we agreed to acquire majority interests in two new wind farms: Thunderhead Wind Energy Center in Nebraska and Blooming Grove Wind Farm in Illinois. Our investment in these projects will total $770 million. • Our infrastructure segment will hold majority interests in five wind farms capable of providing approximately 1,000 megawatts of carbon-free energy outside of our traditional service area. These investments will total nearly $1.4 billion. • These renewable energy assets have long-term agreements to serve investment-grade customers. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated business returns. Our investment strategy and our focus on operating efficiency have supported predictable dividends and dividend growth. • At its January meeting, our board of directors increased the dividend by 7.2 percent over the previous rate. The new annualized dividend is $2.53 a share. • This marks the 17th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. • We continue to target a payout ratio of 65 to 70 percent of earnings. We expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Our goal is to build and sustain long-term value for our stockholders, customers and communities in a rapidly changing industry. • We believe effective corporate governance is an essential driver of stockholder value and a key component to sustainability. Through its succession planning, our board is maintaining its diversity of knowledge, skills, experience, thought, gender, ethnicity and tenure. • Our companies and foundations are among the most active participants in the communities we serve — providing engagement and financial support to worthy organizations. In 2019, charitable giving rose to nearly $20 million. On behalf of our entire management team, thank you for your confidence, your support and your investment in WEC Energy Group. Sincerely, \n",

We committed to completing $10 billion in share repurchases by the end of 2022 and had achieved approximately 55% of our overall goal through the end of January. We also reduced debt by $4.6 billion. In February 2022, we announced Board authorization for an additional $5 billion in incremental share repurchases. Our Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable diesel facility became fully operational in the spring of 2021. With a production capacity of 184 million gallons a year, it is the second largest facility of its kind in the United States. Dickinson also generates a carbon intensity level that is approximately 50% lower than when it operated as a petroleum refinery. Substantial strides were made toward converting our Martinez, California, refinery into a renewable fuels facility, including publication of the project’s draft environmental impact report and completion of the report’s public comment period. We are currently progressing through the remaining stages of permitting and continue to target starting production at the facility in the second half of 2022. In 2023, we anticipate ramping up pretreatment capabilities and increasing production to the full capacity of 730 million gallons per year. The performance of our MPLX midstream segment throughout 2021 reflected the resilience of our logistics business and the benefits of an integrated value chain.

            "The COVID-19 pandemic had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. Our industry, like so many others, faced unprecedented challenges but I am incredibly proud of Team Valero for their dedication to keeping our company moving forward, making products that people depend on in our country and across the globe. Valero, considered part of the country’s critical infrastructure, kept operating safely throughout the pandemic and honored our long-standing commitments to safety, environmental stewardship, our communities and our stockholders during this time. Our focus on safety, combined with investments in reliability and environmental stewardship, provide the foundation for our operations excellence. In fact, we achieved several operational records last year, delivering our best year ever in safety and environmental performance. This dedication is what makes Valero a best-inclass producer of fuels and products that are essential to modern life. Valero entered the economic downturn in a position of strength, and our team was thorough, decisive and swift in its operational and financial response. Operationally, we adjusted the throughput rates at our refineries to more closely match product supply with demand to ensure that our supply chain did not become physically infeasible. We also temporarily idled a number of our ethanol plants and reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at the remaining plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol. Financially, we remained well capitalized. We entered into a new $875 million revolving credit facility and raised $4 billion of debt at attractive rates for additional liquidity. We also temporarily suspended buybacks in mid-March and reduced our capital budget by over $500 million while keeping our high return, low-carbon projects moving forward. Through all of this we never wavered in our commitment to stockholders. Valero returned $1.8 billion to our owners, while maintaining its dividend and investment grade credit ratings, ending the year with over $3 billion of cash and more than $9 billion of total available liquidity. Despite the challenges and hardships through the pandemic, I was encouraged to see individuals selflessly helping and stepping up to support those in need. In this spirit of giving, I am proud that Valero continued to support the communities where we operate, with employee volunteerism and more than $58 million in charitable contributions, including COVID-19 relief funding – for food, shelter, educational resources and other life necessities. Recognizing the world wants cleaner fuels, and consistent with our long-standing commitment to sustainability, we shared our plan to reduce and offset 63% of refining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025. And we have line of sight to this target with projects that have been approved by the Board and are already in execution. These renewable energy projects reduce the carbon intensity of our products while earning attractive returns to further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage. We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher growth markets with the start of waterborne product shipments to the new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. Our framework served us well during a challenging 2020 just as it has in previous years, and we’ll continue to adhere to it in the future. We remain steadfast in our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations with a disciplined capital allocation framework, investing for earnings growth through innovation and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. \n",

            "The global oil and gas industry faced an unprecedented set of challenges during 2020 – the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic headwinds and OPEC+ turmoil. In addition, the energy industry continued to transition from a growth model to a model focused on generating free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders. Pioneer met these challenges and delivered strong 2020 operational results, significant free cash flow, and enhanced environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments. We responded quickly and effectively to the pandemic in order to keep our employees safe and productive. We navigated the difficult price environment by reducing our capital spending and cost structure, while continuing to drive efficiency gains in our operations. We also announced the acquisition of Parsley Energy (Parsley), complementing Pioneer’s unparalleled inventory of high-return wells in the Permian Basin. Finally, we maintained capital discipline and generated almost $700 million in free cash flow1 – much of which was returned to shareholders. These accomplishments position the company for long-term success by creating value for our investors, supporting and caring for our people, and being responsive to a wide array of stakeholder interests, including those focused on ESG issues. PANDEMIC RESPONSE The health and safety of our employees is the number one priority for Pioneer. The pandemic created unique challenges for companies and organizations globally. We quickly assembled an internal cross-disciplinary team to lead our response. Guidance from local, state and federal authorities drove our initial actions. Pioneer went above and beyond to provide a safe work environment that not only kept our employees healthy, but also allowed them to successfully and effectively execute their work. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 2020 was Pioneer’s most successful year from an operations standpoint. The company produced 367 MBOPED for the year. We established corporate records in both drilled and completed feet per day, bringing on some of the most prolific wells in the Permian Basin. Facilities costs on a per-well basis continued to decline at a material rate. Our relentless focus on lowering costs and increasing efficiencies resulted in Pioneer’s peer-leading maintenance breakeven price of approximately $29 per barrel WTI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the Pioneer balance sheet, combined with excellent operating results and cost reductions during 2020, allowed us to increase our base dividend to $2.24 per share in early 2021 (the fourth year in a row we have increased the base dividend). We also initiated a variable dividend policy that will further enhance the return of capital to shareholders beginning in 2022. From 2021-2026, Pioneer expects to generate $16 billion in free cash flow1 , with the majority expected to be returned to shareholders through dividends (based on a WTI oil price of $52 per barrel). Synergies from our acquisition of Parsley are forecasted to reach $350 million – exceeding our initial expectations by $25 million. Debt refinancing in January 2021 resulted in total net debt of approximately $5.2 billion, with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2%. Pioneer continues to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry, and we are committed to strengthening it further. Over the long-term, we plan to use 25% of our free cash flow to further reduce debt. This strategy ensures Pioneer will have the financial flexibility to meet future business-cycle challenges. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE ESG remains a priority for Pioneer. On the environmental front, we continue to focus on our emissions footprint. Pioneer’s CO2 intensity per barrel is among the very lowest – 70% below the average among large, global operators2 . We have also committed to aggressive targets directed at reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity, methane emission intensity and routine flaring. Regarding social initiatives, Pioneer is dedicated to building an engaging and diverse workforce. We believe in fostering an environment where differences in cultures, people and thoughts are celebrated. It has been our long-standing belief that such a workforce delivers superior business results. We have also continued to work closely with nonprofit groups in Irving and throughout the Permian Basin to support a variety of organizations working to address areas of need in those communities. Finally, on governance, we have enhanced our executive compensation program to ensure the majority of executive equity compensation continues to be aligned with our shareholders. We have included the S&P 500 index into our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) peer group beginning of 2021. Pioneer also announced our commitment to follow the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure guidelines. While these are our 2020 ESG highlights, many other  actions and policies are being developed to ensure Pioneer remains a the industry forefront on these issues. 2021 Outlook Pioneer plans to run between 18 to 20 drilling rigs in2021 and place between 385 and 415 wells on production. The lateral length of these wells is expected to average 9,900 feet. Our well mix by formation will be roughly divided into Wolfcamp B (40%), Wolfcamp A (40%), Spraberry (15%) in the Midland Basin and the remaining 5% in the Delaware Basin. Pioneer’s total capital budget is planned to range from $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, including $100 million of spending related to Parsley integration expenses. Production is estimated to range from 307-322 MBOPD and 528-554 MBOEPD. We expect to generate approximately $2 billion in free cash flow for the year. Excess cash flow will be allocated toward the base dividend, strengthening our balance sheet and beginning a variable dividend in 2022. We believe this plan delivers on our commitment to return significant capital to shareholders, while strengthening our balance sheet. CONCLUSION While 2020 was indeed a particularly challenging year for our industry, the resilience, hard work and determination our employees demonstrated was truly inspiring. To overcome the obstacles we faced, and deliver the results we did, is a testament to our greatest asset – our people. Pioneer’s balance sheet, capital discipline and unmatched asset base, delivering low-risk, high-return wells, positions us to deliver strong financial results and generate significant free cash flow, supporting our commitment to return capital to shareholders. Our industry is constantly changing. At Pioneer, we pride ourselves on being able to successfully manage through these changes. We are excited to be well on the way to delivering on our 2021 goals, and I look forward to highlighting them in this letter next year. Thank you for your investment in our company. \n",

The attached Notice of the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Meeting”) and Proxy Statement contain information about the business to be conducted at the Meeting. We also encourage you to read about your Board, our environmental, social and governance practices, and our executive compensation programs in the accompanying Proxy Statement. We will conduct the Meeting online for the health and safety of our shareholders, employees and the broader community. See the “Attending the Virtual Annual Meeting” section of “Questions and Answers about the Annual Meeting” in the accompanying Proxy Statement for instructions on how to register to participate in the virtual annual meeting. A Culture of Doing the Right Thing The events since mid-2020 have been deeply humbling for FirstEnergy’s Board and leadership. We are working tirelessly to move forward as a stronger, integrity-bound organization that puts doing the right thing at the heart of our business as we serve our customers and their evolving energy needs. We have taken decisive actions over the past two years and are focused on building a culture of uncompromising compliance, ethics, integrity and accountability. At the same time, we are strengthening our business and putting customers at the heart of all we do. We remain committed to working cooperatively with stakeholders and demonstrating FirstEnergy’s core values to rebuild trust and confidence in the Company while delivering safe, reliable and affordable electric service. Executing Our Strategy FirstEnergy’s strategy is to become a premier electric utility built on a strong foundation, with an unrelenting customer focus, that leads and enables the energy transition. Highlights of our progress include: ▪ We are building a stronger, diverse and inclusive culture to better serve customers, improve operational performance, spark innovation, and provide a more rewarding and equitable work experience for all employees. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, much like Safety, is a core value that is foundational to everything we do. Recognizing, developing and leveraging the unique strengths of our employees helps make FirstEnergy a more innovative and resilient company, and motivates employees to build their careers with us. ▪ We are unlocking opportunities to enhance our business, including through FE Forward, our customer-focused effort to modernize our Company, unlock our potential and deliver sustainable value to all stakeholders. ▪ We announced $3.4 billion of equity financings with two premier global infrastructure funds. These transformative financings are expected to strengthen FirstEnergy’s financial position, capitalize on incremental investment opportunities and address all non-SIP/DRIP equity plans. Blackstone Infrastructure Partners invested $1 billion in FirstEnergy common equity and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners is acquiring a 19.9% minority interest in FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC for $2.4 billion. These transactions allow us to strengthen our business and fund strategic capital expenditures that will help us support our climate strategy and enable a sustainable energy transition. An Engaged Board Dedicated to Strong Corporate Governance Your Company is dedicated to strong corporate governance, which we view as foundational to our business and important to advancing the interests of our shareholders. Your Board oversees and guides FirstEnergy’s business strategy, including your Company’s efforts to drive integrity and accountability and make progress on environmental, social and governance matters.

Klimczak have been nominated for election at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and six long-term Board members will not stand for reelection: Michael J. Anderson, Thomas N. Mitchell, Christopher D. Pappas, Luis A. Reyes, Julia L. Johnson and myself. On behalf of this group, it has been our privilege to serve on your Board, and I am confident your Company will continue to grow stronger under the leadership and guidance of our 2022 director nominees. We also recognize the importance of diversity in our business and leadership, including on our Board. Our Board nominees demonstrate diversity in the form of gender, ethnicity, age, tenure, thought, background and experiences. Of note, women and ethnic minorities currently represent 33% of our Board nominees Our Bright Future On behalf of your board, I want to express my appreciation for the dedicated efforts of FirstEnergy employees.

Bright, high-performing people thrive in a supportive culture – and when our people thrive, our company becomes more collaborative, innovative and successful. I truly believe that a culture where everyone feels valued, trusted and empowered isn’t just a mark of a strong organization – it’s the making of an even stronger one. At Emerson, we are resolutely focused on modernizing our workplace. This will ensure that our company evolves with the changing needs and expectations of today’s talent and is positioned to grow and thrive now and in the future. First and foremost, we are focused on intentional action to foster a culture of inclusivity and diversity. As a global company, we know diverse perspectives and backgrounds are integral to company culture and innovation. I was proud this year when we earned a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index and the designation as one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. While we are proud of this recognition of our efforts to build an inclusive workplace, we have more work to do. We are enhancing our talent acquisition and talent development processes to build our team of women and minority leaders, and earlier this year we introduced a goal of doubling representation at the leadership level of women globally and minorities in the U.S. by 2030. This goal will help us advance our progress towards a workforce that better reflects the communities where we live and work. We have initiated new workplace policies to increase flexibility and enable employees to work in the way best suited to their diverse needs and lifestyles. To lead our efforts to support our people and strengthen the employee experience, this year we appointed Elizabeth Adefioye as Emerson’s first Chief People Officer. With more than 20 years of human resources leadership experience, Elizabeth brings new energy and fresh perspectives to our work to ensure our people and culture agenda support our ambitious business objectives. As a member of Emerson’s Office of the Chief Executive (OCE), Elizabeth will also help develop and guide our global business strategies. We are continuing to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities into Emerson’s culture. ESG issues are a concern of increasing priority for our stakeholders, and for good reason. We are driving business practices that are sustainable and we will do our part to respond to environmental and social issues so our planet and our communities are healthier tomorrow than they are today. To focus our strategic efforts and purpose in this area, this year we appointed Mike Train as Chief Sustainability Officer. This new role, which is part of the OCE, reflects our view of sustainability as integral to everything our company does, and advances the implementation of sustainable practices in our own business and our work to help our customers do the same. This evolution is reflected in our “Greening Of, Greening By, Greening With” framework – to define and articulate how we collaborate and realize not only our own environmental goals, but also those of our customers and stakeholders. As more of our customers set environmental targets, they need technologies, solutions and partners to help measure, track and achieve these goals. I look forward to telling more of this story in our 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, to be released in early 2022. OUR PORTFOLIO DRIVES VALUE As our culture enables our employees to create truly groundbreaking approaches to innovation – it’s our portfolio that reflects the results of our work to develop solutions to the most important challenges our customers face. We have two world-class platforms today that are market leaders in their respective spaces, operate at world-class levels of profitability and create value for Emerson’s shareholders. We are committed to continuously renewing our business portfolio to ensure we are positioned to deliver long-term value creation. Towards this goal, we conducted a comprehensive review of our business portfolio with the objective of positioning Emerson into end markets with higher underlying growth rates and supportive macro-economic trends. Emerson is well positioned today and will be better positioned tomorrow to support our customers and their efforts around a sustainable future. We will continue to invest in new technologies and software capabilities that enable customers to achieve their objectives in essential industries such as life sciences, power generation and transmission, energy, cold chain, and food and water. Our portfolio evolution will be thoughtfully executed over time as we identify and implement opportunities to create value for our shareholders. W E M A I N T A I N O U R F O C U S ON EXECUTION AND RESULTS As we transform our culture and portfolio, we maintain our long-standing focus on operational execution and financial results. For the year, net sales were up 9%, and adjusted earnings per share were $4.10, up 19%. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, up 16%, which reflected higher earnings due to volume, operational execution across the two business platforms and favorable trade working capital. We began a comprehensive margin improvement program in the second half of 2019 and committed to driving profitability to previous historical highs. This program identified actions to realize $650 million of annualized savings by 2023 through optimization of our organizational structure and rationalization of our global facility footprint. These actions included workforce and facility rationalizations, business unit consolidations, and continued centralization of certain core functions, and were intended to reduce structural costs and streamline operational decisions. The targeted savings from the cost reset program drove the strong profitability improvement reflected in our 2021 results. The remaining savings will be realized through 2023, and we are on track to meet our profitability targets previously communicated. Our strong 2021 financial results were achieved despite a challenging operational environment in the second half of the year. Emerson’s regional manufacturing strategy combined with multi-sourcing arrangements and strong supplier relationships positioned us well to navigate these challenges. We are thankful for the extraordinary efforts made by our operations teams to continue to meet our customer needs. We’re also privileged to be guided by a strong Board of Directors with diverse industry and geographical experience. In May, we appointed James Turley as independent Chair of the Board, succeeding David N. Farr after his retirement. A member of Emerson’s Board since 2013 and Chair and CEO of Ernst & Young for more than a decade, Jim’s experience with Emerson and in finance, public company service and executive leadership are a true asset. Jim has and will continue to be a valued partner to Emerson. As I reflect on my first year as Emerson’s CEO, I’m incredibly thankful for the past and current leaders of our company who have built a solid foundation. Our progress this year would not have been possible without the dedicated leadership of the Office of the Chief Executive or the Board of Directors. I’m grateful to have such an extraordinary team of individuals that are united in strengthening Emerson and committed to helping the company achieve its full potential. This is an energizing time in the history of our company. Thank you, our shareholders, for your ongoing support and involvement. I hope you share in my excitement for Emerson’s next chapter of global leadership and industry evolution.\n",

            "2020 was a year when our company, our communities, and our world were challenged in ways we had never seen before. It was a year when we learned a lot about ourselves, how we respond to rapid change, and what really matters. The COVID-19 health and financial crisis disrupted many businesses. In an unparalleled stress test, we kept our global team safe, we kept our business running and we continued to be there for our customers. We absorbed risk, delivered on our commercial commitments, and improved our safety metrics along the way. We maintained our financial position as the counterparty of choice to our global aviation, marine, and land-based customers, suppliers and partners. I am proud of my 5,000 colleagues and the outcomes they achieved in this challenging year. The cloud infrastructure we invested in over the last three years combined with cloud storage, collaboration, and communications applications and platforms provided a functional set of workforce-ready tools enabling us to quickly transition to remote working and keep commercial activities running. We digitized transactions, documents, and communications, and moved hundreds of suppliers and customers to our apps and portal solutions. These efforts reduce costs, lower the combined carbon footprint for ourselves and our business partners, and increase our market value by establishing greater operational integration. We are taking our large and liquid analog transportation fuel marketplace and turning it into a digital energy ecosystem to reduce costs for ourselves and our partners, drive greater operational efficiencies and lower our collective carbon footprint. Our energy management business has continued to evolve its natural gas, power, wind, solar, carbon and renewables activities. We provided energy advisory services to businesses in 55 countries and sourced renewable energy from 190 renewable power plants. We have managed and sold growing volumes of electricity and natural gas. We also concluded solar power agreements with various communities, as well as agreements with utility-scale solar projects for Fortune 500 companies. Looking ahead, we will continue to participate in the energy transition through our own sustainability journey and supporting our customers and suppliers with products and services to help them with theirs. Since 2012, we have had the in-house expertise to meet the needs of our stakeholders by helping them reduce their carbon footprint through efficiency engineering, sourcing wind and solar power, procuring and selling carbon credits, and more recently sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable diesel.\n",
            "\n",
            "As society has passed the tipping point on climate action, we are well positioned to serve the sustainability needs of the market. Embracing diversity and focusing on ESG with our commitment to the principles of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an important business initiative for us. Thanks to our focus on culture where diverse talent, creative thought, and collaboration reign supreme, our global team showed great strength of character, tremendous resilience, and a burning desire to succeed in an extremely difficult environment. I want to, once again, sincerely thank each and every one of my colleagues for their extraordinary efforts. While our 2020 operating results and the industries in which we serve were significantly impacted by the pandemic, our team did a great job of managing risks and costs while strengthening our balance sheet over the course of the year. Today, our business is providing support for the expected resurgence in passenger travel and commercial activity in aviation, marine, and land, as local and global markets reopen. We continue to refine and enhance our solutions and expand our global networks, clearly demonstrating our strategic value. The work we completed internally on talent, leadership, and culture will push us forward to execute in 2021, as we continue to scale our comprehensive energy and logistics offering. Our dedicated team members are continuing to stand shoulder to shoulder with our customers, suppliers, and stakeholders as we come out of this global pandemic. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the people around us, and being apart only brought us closer together and overcoming adversity only made us stronger. \n",

            "As our company and the energy industry evolve, our dedication to our mission remains as strong as ever. We are committed to serving you, our investors, by earning fair returns on and being good stewards of your investments. We are committed to serving our customers by safely delivering reliable, affordable, sustainable, and increasingly clean energy. We are committed to serving our communities through our energy-assistance programs and charitable giving, and through our focus on environmental justice. We are committed to serving our employees by helping them reach their full potential. And we are committed to protecting the environment by cutting emissions and preserving natural resources. In 2021, the people of Dominion Energy continued to focus on operational excellence as we evolved our business and positioned the company for long-term, sustainable success. Our deep roots have enabled us to weather recent storms, and we are growing your company in new directions. Among the storms we faced last year was Tom’s untimely death. Under his leadership, your company evolved from a diversified energy company into an increasingly pure-play, state-regulated utility holding company. Tom’s greatest legacy was building a company capable of thriving without him, by instilling the core corporate values that guide us every day. Dominion Energy’s continued success is a great testament to Tom, and I am humbled and honored to succeed him. YEAR IN REVIEW Throughout 2021, we delivered on our primary mission: to supply our customers with reliable, affordable, sustainable, and clean energy — to keep the lights on and the gas flowing — and to do so safely. We continued our company’s growth and our pursuit of our vision: to become the most sustainable energy company in America. We advanced our clean-energy strategy by: • Reaching agreement on major contracts for the 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind commercial project, or CVOW; • Proposing new solar and energy storage projects in our second annual clean energy filing in Virginia — the largest such group ever proposed; • Completing ThermH2, a pilot project in Utah to test blending hydrogen with natural gas. We have commenced a similar pilot in North Carolina and are in the early stages of doing so in Ohio; • Increasing the number of renewable natural gas (RNG) projects under construction around the country to 10, as of this writing; and Continuing to hit milestones on important projects. For instance: – We received a Notice of Intent from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for CVOW in July as planned, and filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the State Corporation Commission of Virginia (SCC) on schedule in November; and – Dominion Energy Virginia reached 1 million installed smart meters, and Dominion Energy South Carolina surpassed 550,000. These developments embody our core value of Embrace Change. By turning ideas and opportunities into reality, projects such as these create excitement around the company. At the same time, we continue to aim ever higher in the safe delivery of the reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy that our customers know they can count on. Our efforts to improve operational performance embody our core value of Excellence. For example, in 2021: • We have made significant progress on safety since we made it the company’s top core value 15 years ago. We continue to achieve steady progress, cutting our OSHA recordable injury rate by nearly 30% over the past five years. • Excluding major storms, Dominion Energy South Carolina’s customers went without power for less than 75 minutes — 13 fewer minutes than the year before. Our Virginia and North Carolina customers went without power for roughly 132 minutes — 8 minutes less than in 2020, and a 17-minute improvement over 2019. We received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the license for Surry Power Station — a two-reactor nuclear facility in southeastern Virginia — ensuring that it will continue to serve customers through mid-century, or eight decades after it went online, and twice as long as originally planned — a testament to our employees’ dedication to safety and high standards. Together, our nuclear fleet generated power more than 90% of the time in 2021, despite five planned outages to refuel the reactor cores. • We secured the rights to more than 100,000 acres of land in Virginia to support our solar goals. • We constructively resolved substantial rate cases in Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and WestVirginia. • We invested more than $1 billion in electric transmission infrastructure in Virginia and North Carolina, where we rebuilt or added more than 164 miles of transmission lines, added 15 substations, and finished more than 300 substation-related projects at existing facilities. In South Carolina, we invested more than $175 million in electric transmission infrastructure, rebuilt or added more than 115 miles of transmission lines, and finished more than 40 substation-related projects at new or existing facilities. • We earned recognition from Escalent Market Research, a behavior and analytics firm, as one of the most trusted business partner utilities, in part because of the environmental dedication of our North Carolina gas distribution company. The firm also recognized Dominion Energy Virginia as an Escalent Market Research Business Customer Champion Award winner for exemplary performance in engaging business customers. • On average, we responded to emergency calls at our five gas distribution companies within half an hour, 30 minutes faster than most state requirements. FINANCIAL RESULTS The company’s core values and its first-rate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy continue to drive strong results. In 2021, we powered through the ongoing headwinds of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures to meet our financial goals. The company reported $3.98 per share in earnings in 2021, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Operating earnings came in at $3.86 per share, up 9% from $3.54 per share in 2020.* Dominion Energy paid out $2.52 per share in dividends on common stock. And our total shareholder return in 2021 — your company’s share-price appreciation and its quarterly dividend payouts — amounted to 8.1%. Looking ahead, we have projected up to $73 billion in climate-focused investments through the end of 2035 — which we believe is the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity for any U.S. public utility company. We expect to invest $37 billion in growth capital in the next five years. More than 85% of our fiveyear growth capital plan is focused on decarbonization. Importantly, about 75% of this is eligible for rider recovery. Through 2026, we anticipate an annual operating earningsper-share growth of 6.5%,** and a dividend growth rate on common stock of 6% annually, subject to quarterly declaration and determination by the Board of Directors. Our growth plans are also reflected in recent financing activity. In 2021, the company entered into two sustainability-linked credit facilities totaling $6.9 billion: a $6 billion master credit facility that ties certain pricing parameters to the achievement of annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion milestones, and a separate $900 million credit facility, believed to be the first of its kind globally, that provides a reduced interest rate when our borrowings are used to fund clean-generation infrastructure or social investments such as supporting diverse-owned businesses, enhancing diversity within our workforce, or supporting marginalized populations within our communities. We also issued $1 billion in green bonds in 2021 to finance eligible clean-energy projects. Notably, in February 2022 we announced plans to sell our Dominion Energy West Virginia gas distribution business to Ullico Inc.’s infrastructure fund. The transaction will support company efforts to focus on five primary states where we serve customers. We believe this change, together with our broader long-term growth plans, will benefit you, our investors. CUSTOMERS EXPECT OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Dominion Energy demonstrates excellence when we meet or exceed expectations. Excellence begins with safety, the most important of our core values. In 2021, we turned in our second-best performance ever, owing to a slight bump in safety-related incidents as more people returned to the workplace. Our track record of improvement shows we can do better, and we will. Our customers’ highest priority is reliability. They expect their power will come on when they need it — period. In the past year, our customers in our electric service areas in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina had their power 99.9% of the time, excluding major storms. Our grid improvement investments are reducing the number of minutes customers lack power, and we have received industry recognition for our mobile STATCOM, an innovative power electronic device that responds to electric transmission network anomalies within milliseconds. Our gas distribution business maintains an 811 “Call Before You Dig” program to prevent third-party damage to our pipelines, which is the primary cause of incidents involving natural gas pipelines. We know our service is essential. Our efforts to reduce third-party damage to our gas infrastructure have paid off with a reduction of 16.3% in such damage over the past two years. When major storms approach, we stage equipment and people to be ready so crews can swing into action as soon as it is safe to do so, as we did for the first winter storm of 2022 that dumped wet, heavy snow on most of Virginia. Depending on a storm’s severity, we often rely on help from other utilities. In return, we support other companies when they must combat severe weather. Thanks to these practices and preparations, the company has received several Emergency Response Awards for power restoration from the Edison Electric Institute, including one for recovery after the Valentine’s Day storm in February 2021, as described in “Answering the Call” on p. 8. Our customers also expect value for their money. Across our service areas, we are working to keep rates low and competitive with other energy alternatives. As of the end of 2021, residential and industrial electric rate averages at Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy South Carolina remained below national and regional averages. In fact, the typical Virginia residential customer’s bill has risen only 0.7% a year on average for the past couple of decades — well below the 1.8% average rate of inflation over that time. The substantial investments we are making in clean energy will entail costs, but we anticipate the typical Dominion Energy Virginia customer’s bill to rise an average of just 2.1% per year through 2035 — substantially below the current level of inflation. In 2021 and early 2022, comprehensive rate settlements were approved in Virginia and both Carolinas that will support continued capital investment; ensure customers continue receiving reliable, affordable, and increasingly sustainable energy; and balance the interests of all our stakeholders. In addition, pursuant to our successfully completed rate settlement in South Carolina, Dominion Energy forgave more than $11 million in past-due balances for electric customers and committed up to $15 million of funding for home energy-efficiency upgrades and critical health and safety repairs. All told in Virginia, working with state lawmakers, we forgave more than $200 million in 2020 and 2021. As always, we found ways to manage expenses to help keep customer rates low, through systemic efforts such as our Buy Smart procurement program — which looks for efficiencies and cost savings. Also, in our Western states, our unique, cost-of-service gas production helps customers avoid price spikes. In fact, we estimate that our customers saved over $100 million in just a seven-day period during the winter storms experienced last February, thanks to this regulatory structure. While reliability and value remain our customers’ top concerns, some are looking for additional services. In 2021, we expanded our menu of green-energy programs. Now residential customers in Virginia can buy solar through BrightSuite’s residential solar program. Customers in Utah and Idaho can buy RNG in small, affordable blocks through our GreenTherm program. SERVING COMMUNITIES Our core value of Ethics calls us to consider the welfare of others. With COVID-19 lingering throughout 2021, we continued our pandemic relief efforts — including the suspension of service shutoffs due to nonpayment for the first nine months of the year. We also offer shortterm bill extensions, and long-term payment plans. Our EnergyShare program, which began 40 years ago, helps qualified customers with energy bill payment. For 2020- 2021, we increased our funding of EnergyShare 18%. As the pandemic wore on, we continued to address human needs, support education, contribute to community vitality, and protect the environment though the work of the Dominion Energy Charitable Foundation. In 2021, the company contributed $48.6 million across our service areas through the Foundation, corporate direct-giving and energy-assistance programs, and more. As owner and operator of several public service companies that are part of the broader social fabric, we recognize that being a part of our communities means forming ties with businesses in those communities. We are working hard to increase the number of small, local, and diverse* companies we rely on for goods and services. These efforts are paying off: We have increased spending with diverse suppliers 91% from 2015 through 2021, eclipsing a billion dollars in a year for the first time ever. Four years ago, we adopted a formal environmental justice policy to ensure that we hear, fully consider, and respond to the concerns of all our stakeholders regardless of race, color, national origin, or income as we pursue our infrastructure-development initiatives. With the implementation of this policy, we have developed rigorous internal processes to ensure accountability and follow-through and have a dedicated staff for environmental justice that develops comprehensive training for employees. All major construction projects are reviewed for environmental justice considerations. In 2021, that meant more than 75 projects were reviewed. LOWER EMISSIONS, CLEANER ENERGY A key component of Dominion Energy’s growth plan is our commitment to achieving net zero Scope 1 carbon dioxide and methane emissions from our power generation and gas infrastructure operations by 2050. We are well on our way. From 2005 through 2020, we cut carbon emissions from our power generating facilities 43%, and we cut methane emissions from our gas distribution operations 32% from 2010 to 2020. Moving forward, we expect to meet these intermediate targets: a 55% reduction in carbon and a 65% reduction in methane by 2030, and an 80% reduction in methane by 2040. (For more details, visit sustainability.dominionenergy.com.) We are on course to hit each of these milestones. Moreover, our goal is to invest up to $8 billion in gas distribution modernization and carbon-beneficial RNG projects through 2035. Combined, these RNG projects should bring Dominion Energy’s natural gas businesses effectively to net zero 10 years before the company as a whole. Our most recent Climate Report, released in July 2021, was based on the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It provides a snapshot of possibilities for meeting our emissions goals under different scenarios. You can find that report, our Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility Report, and our 2021 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report — along with other information about our ESG work — at esg.dominionenergy.com. Since 2005, coal has declined from half our electricity production to approximately 10%. By the end of the decade, as part of our ongoing resource planning, we intend to (1) operate and maintain only a few of our remaining coal-fired stations for reliability and energy security considerations; (2) extend certain licenses for our carbon-free nuclear fleet; and (3) shift to natural gas, which not only lowers emissions— compared with emissions from coal-fired power stations — but has the quick-start capacity to support renewable generation. Indeed, we would not be able to incorporate as much renewable energy as we have — and as we plan to — without it. Renewable generation is central to our long-term strategy. At present, our most ambitious single renewable-energy effort is CVOW. When completed in 2026, its 2.6 GW are expected to power about 660,000 homes at peak output. We expect its 176 turbines to avoid up to 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year — the equivalent of taking 1 million non-electric cars off the road. While CVOW is the biggest offshore wind farm under development on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, it is only one piece of our clean-energy strategy. By the end of 2035, pursuant to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, we expect to build 5.2 GW of offshore wind, and to own, operate, or contract for 16.1 GW of solar generation, as well as 2.7 GW of storage. We are making good progress: Through December 2021, our Virginia solar assets, in operation or development, stood at 6.8 GW. Just as we need natural gas to step in when demand for power exceeds what solar and wind can provide, we need to store excess power when solar and wind generation outpaces electricity demand. To that end, we continue to develop energy storage in the form of batteries. We are working to ensure natural gas is part of the solution to a clean-energy future, including through dramatic reductions in methane emissions, access to RNG, and exploration of the potential for hydrogen-blending. Our nuclear fleet continues to provide baseload generation around the clock. Our Surry and North Anna Power Stations produce nearly a third of the electricity used by our Virginia customers — including 92% of current carbon-free energy. Our Millstone Power Station provides nearly half of Connecticut’s electricity and more than 90% of its carbon-free electricity. In South Carolina, our V.C. Summer Power Station provides nearly a third of the utility’s owned power production and 91% of its carbonfree generation. We are upgrading the electric grid to make it smarter, stronger, more resilient, and more capable of handling the complexity of managing both traditional and intermittent renewable generation. Our generating fleet has grown from a couple dozen sites to nearly 100 renewable sites alone, and could exceed 400 sites by the end of the decade. Our Grid Transformation Plan in Virginia represents a comprehensive strategy to meet these challenges. In January 2022, the SCC approved the plan, subject to certain requirements. Through 2026, we expect to invest as much as $7 billion — about a fifth of our total growth capital investment over five years — on enterprise-wide electric grid transformation. At the same time, we are making our natural gas systems stronger, safer, and lower-emitting. We are modernizing the distribution system, implementing advanced leak detection and repair programs, and developing new procedures to drive methane emissions down within our operations. We are also working to allow customers to lower their emissions, with access to GreenTherm RNG, carbon-offset programs, and increased energy-efficiency programs. In Utah, we are rolling out our carbon offset program through which customers can offset their entire natural gas carbon footprint for about $60 per year. All told, we plan to spend in excess of $315 million a year modernizing our pipeline infrastructure.* DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION Our workforce continues to benefit from growing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). In fact, all our stakeholders benefit, as diverse companies tend to be more innovative and productive. We know fostering DE&I is not only the right thing to do, it provides us with a competitive advantage and supports our longterm growth plan. While our journey is a marathon, not a sprint, I am pleased with our progress. From 2016 through 2021, we increased our diverse hiring rate from 36.2% to 56.2%, and increased diverse workforce representation from 31.9% to 35.4%.** Two years ago we set a target of increasing diverse representation 1 percentage point a year to at least 40% by year-end 2026. Since then we have increased diverse representation 2.2 percentage points. This progress on diversity, along with our evolving culture of equity and inclusion, demonstrates our commitment to our core value of One Dominion Energy. We are pursuing equity in other ways, too. Through the HBCU PromiseSM, we have pledged $25 million to historically black colleges and universities, because we know education is one of the most effective ways to address historic inequities. We also committed $10 million to a Dominion Energy Educational Equity Scholarship Program to support students from underrepresented communities. And through our rural-broadband program, * Dollar value incorporates assumed sale of Dominion Energy West Virginia. ** For workforce purposes, we define “diverse” as non-minority female, minority male, minority female, and undeclared female. we are helping to bring high-speed internet — a necessity for commerce, schooling, medical care, and more — to help underserved communities prosper. BRINGING THE FUTURE FORWARD Each year the company hosts an Innovation Expo, where employee ideas are judged by a panel of executives. In 2021, the Chair’s Excellence Award went to a team that proposed using solar panels for voltage support — a concept with the potential to save Dominion Energy millions of dollars. And we are putting to good use innovations from others — such as using drones to inspect above-ground pipes, remote distribution lines, and nuclear containment domes. Expect us to continue to innovate daily and create new opportunities. In 2021, we joined with five other utilities to form the Electric Highway Coalition, which is creating a network of fast-charging stations to serve electric vehicles (EVs) and since has expanded into a broader national coalition. We continue to invest in EV charging options to deploy electric school buses in Virginia, and to invest in EV charging options for homes, workplaces, and public transit locations such as airports. At the same time, we are leading by example: We have committed to convert 75% of company passenger vehicles and half of all work vehicles to electric power by 2030. THANK YOU Thanks to the hard work and high standards of our 17,100 employees, from those on the front lines across the 13 states where we operate to those who perform essential services behind the scenes, in 2021, Dominion Energy kept the lights on and the gas flowing for our customers. And we lived our values. We are excited by the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity for a public utility company. This will support our vision of becoming the most sustainable energy company in the country. With your support, we expect to continue to meet your expectations and achieve our goals in 2022. \n",

            "2021 was a year of historic change for GE. We focused and de-risked the company through strategic portfolio actions, significantly accelerated our debt reduction, and improved our operating performance through lean and decentralization. Despite the global pandemic and supply chain challenges, we persevered and effectively served our customers while continuing to invest in profitable growth with leading technology and innovation. Add to this the resilience of our employees and we exited the year with big opportunities ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "We continued to make progress on our transformation and successfully built a new GE; one that is a simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial company. In 2021, we significantly reduced our debt, bringing our total gross debt reduction over three years to $87 billion. Given this ongoing hard work and the dedication of our employees, we are operating from a position of strength, focused on important growth sectors in aviation, healthcare, and energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is with this confidence that we were able to announce in November our plans to transform the company by forming three independent, investment-grade industry leaders with sustainability at their core. We will spin off Healthcare first in early 2023, combine Renewable Energy, Power, and Digital into one business to launch as an independent public company a year later, thus creating our third company focused on Aviation. This is a defining moment for GE, one which will best position each of our businesses to deliver long-term growth and create value for all our stakeholders.\n",
            "\n",
            "We plan to establish each standalone company with greater focus and flexibility to better serve their customers, respond to distinct industry dynamics, and build deep domain expertise in their respective industries, including a dedicated board of directors. From an employee perspective, we expect each prospective company to provide more business- and industry-oriented career opportunities and incentives, helping us to compete more effectively for talent. And each will have the opportunity to attract a broader and deeper investor base that increasingly wants to be part of more specific industries and missions that have their own appeal. All three companies will have well-capitalized balance sheets and investment-grade ratings that provide a foundation for targeted investments in growth and innovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "GE has a storied and proud history. For 130 years, people have counted on GE to “find out what the world needs… and try to invent it,” as our founder Thomas Edison famously said. This still rings true at GE today and will continue in each of our three future companies. Passionate teams working to find a better way for our customers and the world. I am convinced that the efforts of our employees, collectively and individually, will enable us to successfully execute our strategy. For us at GE, this is more than just a job; it is a purposeful mission — we are building a world that works.\n",
            "\n",
            "POSITION OF STRENGTH\n",
            "\n",
            "I am proud of what our company and employees achieved in 2021.\n",
            "\n",
            "We delivered solid margin* and EPS* performance and $5.8 billion of Industrial free cash flow for the year. Orders were strong, especially in services, setting us up for faster and more profitable growth going forward. Our top-line results were pressured — partly by our decisions to be more selective in the projects and markets we pursue, partly by market factors like supply chain challenges and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. wind production tax credit, and partly due to our own execution.\n",
            "\n",
            "We’re seeing momentum in GE today including near-term improvement in our businesses, especially as Aviation recovers and our end markets strengthen. We expect to deliver between $5.5 billion* and $6.5 billion* free cash flow in 2022 and more than $7 billion* in 2023. Our deleveraging efforts will continue, further solidifying our financial position and allowing GE to play more offense through organic and inorganic growth opportunities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Strong Financial Position\n",
            "\n",
            "We took a huge step in 2021 with the close of the GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) and AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) transaction, creating an industry leader and strategic partner to airline customers. GE now owns approximately 46 percent of the combined company. This combination was an important catalyst to solidify our financial position. We significantly accelerated our total gross debt reduction by more than $50 billion over the year. Following this, we also report the now much smaller remaining GE Capital business as part of Corporate, enabling us to simplify our financial reporting structure and further enhance transparency for our shareholders.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are taking action to de-risk our business and drive sustainable, predictable performance. By making the strategic decision to discontinue the majority of our factoring programs, we enable our businesses to get back to basics on billings and collections, and over time, we expect this will facilitate higher and more linear cash flow.\n",
            "\n",
            "Improved Business and Operating Performance\n",
            "\n",
            "We have continued to strengthen our business, transforming GE into a simpler, leaner, and more effective organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "We enter 2022 with lean taking root across the company. In the simplest of terms, lean is about focusing on the customer and eliminating waste to deliver more value to our customers. Our efforts this past year drove sustainable, impactful improvements in safety, quality, delivery, cost, and cash management. Lean is helping GE rebuild our operational core and transform our culture. Combining this with our historical strength in technology and innovation, each of our businesses has a very strong foundation for continued and faster profitable growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "This customer-centric mindset is building across the company. Our Renewable Energy site in Pensacola, Florida used lean to improve wind turbine yaw-drive assembly which reduced production time by 20 minutes and contributed to increased shift capacity from four to five units. We expect this capacity increase to enable us to maintain on-time delivery for the 2022 schedule. Aviation’s overhaul shops have used lean to decrease turnaround time since 2020, allowing us to return engines to customers faster, and at lower cost. Gas Power Services’ business used lean to develop a new playbook for planned maintenance outage events, which has achieved 30 percent cycle time improvement. Healthcare’s Ultrasound team implemented lean principles of pull and daily management to better meet customer needs, resulting in a 13-percentage-point improvement in on-time delivery. These efficiencies are setting a new industry bar for execution and, most importantly, are delivering value and speed to our customers. Taken together with numerous other measures across the company, including 100,000 employees developing new skills through lean learning courses this year, these actions will meaningfully contribute to the success of our operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are driving lasting cultural change. Our operating system is standardized — with a monthly focus on key performance indicators and a quarterly look at key priorities of talent, strategy, and budgeting. Our new performance management system is driving greater responsibility at an individual level. In addition, with new reporting of our priorities and progress in sustainability and diversity, we are holding ourselves accountable to make improvements within GE and for the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Decentralization goes hand in hand with lean and getting closer to our customers. This means managing the nearly 30 business units within our four segments. We have, therefore, moved the decision-making center of gravity closer to the customer. This will continue to result in greater accountability, more transparency, and better results.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s take a closer look at how these efforts reflect how our teams are running our businesses better.\n",
            "\n",
            "Aviation\n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks to operational improvements and increasing shop visits, Aviation expanded margins in 2021 to 13.5 percent reported, while revenue was slightly down, in line with departure activity. Orders were up across equipment and services, driven by commercial wins. We remain confident in the recovery while actively managing the impact of industry-wide material and labor availability challenges due to COVID-19. Our business is positioned to lead as the commercial aftermarket recovers and military grows.\n",
            "\n",
            "Healthcare\n",
            "\n",
            "Healthcare felt the impact of supply chain disruptions faster than our other businesses in 2021, but the team proactively managed costs, sourcing, and logistics to deliver solid performance. Orders and organic revenue* were up, and margins expanded 70 basis points organically*, giving the team both the capital and the flexibility to play some offense. In 2021, we acquired BK Medical and Zionexa, two exciting companies helping to realize the potential of precision health.\n",
            "\n",
            "Renewable Energy\n",
            "\n",
            "Renewable Energy delivered double-digit orders growth in 2021, but revenue and margin both declined organically*. Onshore Wind is a mature business that faces near-term challenges both structural and of our own making. Offshore Wind demand continues to significantly increase globally, while Grid Solutions is on its way to profitability. Scott Strazik is now leading our energy businesses running a similar play as he ran in Gas Power — being more selective up front about the new business we take on and being more disciplined on cost — and the onus is on us to continue to improve the performance of this business. Long-term, our energy businesses are firmly positioned to lead the energy transition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Power\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2021, Power’s services growth offset decreases in revenue, driven primarily by our selectivity strategy, which includes lower turnkey scope and exercising more discipline in the projects we choose to underwrite. Margins improved more than 300 basis points organically*. Orders were up slightly, driven by services growth offsetting equipment. Gas Power has stabilized, Steam Power continues to exit the new-build coal power market, Power Conversion grew by double digits, and GE Hitachi Nuclear is partnering with customers on the next generation of nuclear technologies. Looking forward, we’ll continue to improve performance by embedding lean principles deeper in the organization, leading to high single-digit margins for the total Power segment in 2023.\n",
            "\n",
            "RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT WORKS\n",
            "\n",
            "GE is positioned to continue to lead in three important growth sectors — creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight, enabling precision health, and driving decarbonization through the energy transition — critical to our customers and the various end-markets that we serve.\n",
            "\n",
            "Future of Flight\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting with Aviation, innovations that improve fuel efficiency are defining the future of flight, and our engines can operate on approved sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) today. Transitioning from petroleum-based fuels to SAF can reduce carbon emissions up to 80 percent, factoring in the entire life cycle of the fuel, significantly contributing to the commercial aviation industry’s long-term goal of net-zero carbon emissions from flight by 2050. In December 2021, a United Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 powered by CFM LEAP-1B engines became the first passenger flight to use 100 percent “drop-in” SAF for one of the aircraft’s two engines. Drop-in SAF can be used interchangeably with conventional jet fuel and requires no modifications to engines and airframes. Customers Etihad Airways, British Airways and many more have also flown commercial flights powered by a SAF fuel blend.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking further out, we are innovating for the next generation of aircraft engines. With CFM International, our 50-50 joint company with Safran Aircraft Engines, GE Aviation launched the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program to demonstrate advanced technologies, with ground and flight tests expected in the middle of this decade. This program could ultimately lead to engines that would use 20 percent less fuel and produce more than 20 percent fewer CO2 emissions than the most efficient jet engines built today. And GE Aviation together with GE Research is advancing commercial hybrid electric propulsion systems through key partnerships with ARPA-E and NASA. We are prioritizing the future of aviation now for a more sustainable future.\n",
            "\n",
            "Precision Health\n",
            "\n",
            "Enabling precision health — integrated, efficient, and highly personalized care — is vital to addressing critical challenges that affect patients and healthcare providers.\n",
            "\n",
            "At a patient level, Healthcare’s acquisition of BK Medical, an advanced surgical visualization company whose technology helps clinicians see inside the patient’s body in real time during surgery, will enable better care, faster surgeries, and reduced complications. Healthcare is focused on supporting the entire continuum of care for patients from diagnosis through therapy and beyond. To do this well, we work every day on improving our own operations. For example, Healthcare’s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics team in Ireland applied lean thinking to create, test, and implement new workflow and preparation sequences that reduced production turnaround times. These changes resulted in extra production capacity of more than two million bottles of contrast media which is used during medical imaging exams to enable better visualization and diagnosis. In 2021, Healthcare introduced its latest pocket-size color ultrasound scanner, Vscan Air, a handheld, wireless device that beams images from the ultrasound probe to an app on a smartphone — bringing an essential tool to the point of care. With 30,000 units in more than 100 countries, our Vscan Family technologies help doctors deliver expanded care to more people, including in rural regions.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the healthcare system continued to contend with COVID-19 in 2021, GE Healthcare implemented a statewide system in Oregon powered by artificial intelligence to give clinicians near real-time information about intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, acute hospital beds and emergency department wait times. In one instance, the Oregon Care System was able to identify the nearest ICU to airlift a critically ill patient to and alert the ambulance crew to pack several liters of the patient’s blood type in the helicopter’s coolers. To date, 65 of the hospitals in Oregon — approximately 95 percent of the state’s beds — are live in the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Energy Transition\n",
            "\n",
            "As a company whose equipment helps generate one-third of the world’s electricity, we have a responsibility to lead the industry’s decarbonization efforts and meet the rising global demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. Our energy businesses provide powerful, integrated solutions with some of the most innovative onshore and offshore wind turbines, most efficient gas turbines, as well as advanced technology to modernize and digitize electrical grids.\n",
            "\n",
            "We believe in the important role of building the breakthrough technologies the world will need in the future, including carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS), low- and zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen for new and existing gas plants, and small modular nuclear reactors. Our gas turbines have already accumulated more than eight million hours running on blends of hydrogen and similar fuels.  Fuels such as clean hydrogen could help avoid millions of tons of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by the end of the decade, and we are building or modifying power plants in the U.S., Australia, and China designed to utilize blends of hydrogen and natural gas as fuel. The Brentwood Power Station in New York is beginning a demonstration project to run on a blend of natural gas and carbon-free “green hydrogen.”\n",
            "\n",
            "We know it will take several years for some of these advances to become technologically and commercially viable, and widely adopted in many parts of the world. Thus, while GE works on breakthrough technologies for tomorrow, we continue to build and deliver state-of-the-art equipment the world needs today to decarbonize the energy sector while building resilience in more than 175 countries around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gas turbines are crucial for providing reliable baseload electricity to complement large wind projects like the 1.05-gigawatt Western Spirit project just commissioned in New Mexico and the 1.485-gigawatt North Central wind farm under construction in Oklahoma. Both wind farms are using wind turbines from our 2-megawatt (MW) family, which has become a stalwart of the industry, with more than 20 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity. Also, our powerful Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype in Rotterdam began operating at 14 MW. One Haliade-X turbine can save up to 52,000 metric tons of CO2, the equivalent of the emissions generated by 11,000 vehicles, in one year.[4] We have over 7 GW of Haliade-X commitments worldwide.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our software is helping digitize the grid to add more renewable energy and make it more resilient. Leveraging our software, utilities can integrate a high penetration of renewables while sustaining grid reliability and resiliency. In addition, data on past outages and weather patterns, for instance, can help pinpoint future spots of vulnerability during a storm — so utilities can speed up repairs and minimize downtime. In 2021, GE Digital acquired grid management software company Opus One to help utilities bring more distributed energy resources online. Our software is paving the way to an autonomous grid that can detect problems and come up with the most efficient solutions, a critical step in accelerating the energy transition.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the impact of GE — every day our people rise to the challenge of building a world that works, in service of a more connected, healthier, and more sustainable future.\n",

            "Today, GE is a stronger, more customer-centric company. We are building a culture that puts safety at the forefront and lean at the center. This clarity of mission provides compelling opportunities for our businesses to define the trajectory of their industries — we shape the future of flight, advance precision health and lead the energy transition — and we do it by getting better every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Take for instance, our work in Lynn, Massachusetts, where I spent a week serving those closest to the work, our operators, as part of a global lean event in early October. Our mission was to improve first-time yield on midframes, a key subassembly of the military engines we produce in Lynn, whose stubborn variability has been negatively impacting our on-time delivery to customers. By the end of the week, we had improved processes for welding and quality checks on midframe parts, improvements that are now delivering 99 percent first-time yield, as compared with 59 percent before the lean event. We are convinced these improvements, when applied with scale, will help us reach our goals for military on-time delivery. And we can improve our performance on the back of these changes for years to come. These constant, incremental changes make us a more efficient, profitable business.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a company with momentum, we are positioned to succeed in the biggest transformation in our history — creating three companies focused on the critical global needs in aviation, healthcare, and energy. Our employees are essential to the success of these businesses, and we will offer them industry-leading opportunities and incentives to advance their careers. We are fortunate to have experienced leaders in place, already at work to execute this planned transformation and stand up each of these businesses for success on day one.\n",

            "\n",
            "Last year, we laid a solid foundation of growth, reaffirming our ability to meet our commitments and allowing us to accelerate our clean energy vision. We received approval of a comprehensive settlement agreement with the North Carolina Attorney General, North Carolina Public Staff and Sierra Club, which resolved all remaining major coal ash management issues in North Carolina and clarified recovery treatment of coal ash costs for the next decade. We raised equity at a premium valuation through a strategic transaction that others in the industry are now replicating by selling a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana to GIC – a leading global investment firm run by the government of Singapore – for $2.05 billion. In September, we completed the first of the two-phase sale transaction; the second phase will be completed by January 2023. Clearing the Path Forward In October, House Bill 951: Energy Solutions for North Carolina was enacted with bipartisan support, making it perhaps the most comprehensive energy legislation in the state’s history. This law positions North Carolina at the forefront of states with carbon reduction goals while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for customers. It includes regulatory reforms, such as performance-based regulation and multiyear rate planning – all designed to better align utility investments with customer needs and improve rate certainty. And after months of constructive dialogue, we entered into a cooperation agreement with Elliott Management. The agreement provided for the appointment of two new independent directors to our Board of Directors, bringing great expertise and diverse perspectives, which is consistent with our focus on enhancing shareholder value.\n",

            "Delivering Results\n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks to these milestone accomplishments and the actions outlined on the following pages, we produced strong financial results and delivered value for those who placed their trust in us. Our adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $5.24 – above the midpoint of our revised guidance range. Last year’s performance was largely driven by growth in our electric and gas utilities, which saw favorable impacts from base rate increases in the Carolinas and Indiana, and our Piedmont Natural Gas business. We also benefited from a strengthening economy, including a 2% increase in electric volumes and robust residential customer growth. We focused on cost management, finding opportunities to increase productivity and flexibility, and prioritized spending based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. Since 2016, we have absorbed inflation and removed approximately $400 million of net regulated Electric and Gas O&M. These savings have created headroom for approximately $3 billion worth of capital projects with no incremental bill impacts. 2021 was also the 95th consecutive year we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. And our stock price increased 14.6% for the year, outpacing the Philadelphia Utility Index (UTY) and the average for our regulated peers. On a Total Shareholder Return basis, we delivered 19.1%, compared to 18.2% for the UTY and 11.3% for our regulated peers. Our results in 2021 show that the fundamentals of our business are solid. We expect to see growth this year due to a combination of customer growth, rate cases and riders across our jurisdictions, including our multiyear rate plan in Florida, and the full-year impact of the Piedmont North Carolina and Kentucky natural gas rate cases. We will also continue our disciplined approach to managing costs, enhancing productivity while maintaining our focus on reliability and affordability for our customers.\n",

            "As a result of our drive to achieve net-zero emissions, we are leading the industry’s largest clean energy transformation. Our path to 2050 is supported by three pillars – collaborating with stakeholders, transforming and readying the system, and creating value. In 2021, we made significant progress in each area.\n",
            "\n",
            "Collaborating with stakeholders The clean energy transition requires an active conversation among our customers, policymakers, investors, and communities. This transition will play out over decades and will need ongoing engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to get it right by balancing our climate goals with reliability and affordability. We believe this process will lead to the best outcomes for our business and our customers, as evidenced by our progress in 2021. Equitable solutions also remain a top priority as we strengthen our commitment to environmental justice and a just transition to cleaner energy. In Indiana, we submitted our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) in December. Benefiting from a yearlong stakeholder engagement effort, the IRP accelerates coal retirements and adds renewables and natural gas generation. In early 2022, we issued a request for proposals for new generation in the state and remain engaged with stakeholders and policymakers on the best path forward. We also continue our resource planning in the Carolinas. As part of House Bill 951, we look forward to delivering a proposed carbon plan to the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) by May 16, including robust stakeholder input. A final plan will be adopted by the NCUC by the end of 2022. We achieved positive settlements in our natural gas local distribution companies in Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee, along with approval of new electric rates in North Carolina following similarly effective agreements. Our ability to reach agreements on these cases underscores the constructive environment in our jurisdictions and allows us to make investments that bring value to our customers and communities. In Ohio, we asked the Public Utilities Commission to review the electric distribution rates and approve a rate adjustment to recover our ongoing investments to improve southwest Ohio’s electricity infrastructure and enhance value to customers. We expect a decision this summer. In North Carolina, we also reached a net metering settlement with solar developers and advocates, similar to the Solar Choice program in place in South Carolina. Our approach shares the benefits of rooftop solar with adopters and non-solar customers alike. We will continue to work through the regulatory process to support a full complement of rooftop solar programs in the Carolinas. Thanks to North Carolina legislation passed in 2019, Duke Energy successfully issued storm securitization bonds in 2021, saving our customers $300 million in restoration costs from a series of historic storms in 2018 and 2019. South Carolina policymakers are considering similar legislation. At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) accepted the application filed by our company and fellow members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM). The approvals allow SEEM to proceed with a trading platform to facilitate a bilateral trading market, which will provide customer benefits through a shared market structure later this year while supporting increased renewables integration in the Southeast. And we’re engaging on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax, and climate policy. We commend Congress and the Administration for coming together in a bipartisan way last year to pass infrastructure legislation. The infrastructure law provides significant opportunities for our company and our peers to partner with the Department of Energy (DOE) and other key agencies to implement our clean energy transformation, including $62 billion for the DOE to develop and deploy new clean energy technologies needed to close the gap to net-zero, such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen, energy storage and carbon capture. This law is an excellent example of the public-private partnerships we need to meet our clean energy goals. We look forward to putting these federal dollars to work.\n",

            "Transforming and readying the system\n",
            "\n",
            "Transforming and readying the system speaks to the hard work our employees do every day – retiring assets as part of the industry’s largest planned coal retirement, building infrastructure for the country’s largest grid, maintaining the nation’s largest regulated nuclear fleet and running a top 10 renewables company. Our system is complex, and we are preparing it to ensure it’s ready to meet our ambitious climate goals. As of 2021, we reduced our carbon emissions by 44% since 2005, the equivalent of taking over 13 million vehicles off the road. We retired five additional coal units in North Carolina and Indiana. Since 2010, we’ve retired 56 units – totaling 7,500 megawatts. We surpassed 10,000 megawatts of owned, operated or purchased renewables and remain on track to reach 16,000 megawatts by 2025 and 24,000 megawatts by 2030. By 2050, we project renewables will be the largest source of energy in our regulated utilities. In our regulated utilities, we brought multiple solar projects online in North Carolina and Florida, keeping the two states in the top five nationally for installed solar capacity. We connected more than 300 megawatts of solar in North Carolina. In Florida, we remain on track to meet our $1 billion commitment to bring 700 megawatts of solar online by the end of 2022 and are executing our $1 billion Clean Energy Connection community solar program, which will add another 750 megawatts of solar by the end of 2024. To complement these resources, we are increasing our investments in energy storage. Our 18-megawatt Lake Placid battery storage facility began serving Florida customers in December. We also added more than 80 megawatts of storage capacity to our Bad Creek pumped-storage hydro station in South Carolina and will add another 170 megawatts by 2023. To ensure cost flexibility while moving to cleaner resources, we enabled three of our Marshall Steam Station units and one Belews Creek unit in North Carolina to burn natural gas. And we successfully placed the Robeson liquefied natural gas facility in service for Piedmont Carolinas customers last year.\n",

            "To get us even closer to our net-zero methane emissions goal by 2030, we announced a partnership with Accenture and Microsoft in our natural gas distribution business on a first-of-its-kind methane emissions monitoring platform. The new technology uses satellites to identify and track emissions, allowing us to more quickly repair leaks. But we can’t achieve our goals without the workhorse of our system – nuclear power. It provides more than 80% of the carbon-free power on our system. Last year, we filed the first subsequent license renewal application for our largest nuclear asset – Oconee Nuclear Station – and intend to file for all 11 units to keep these valuable assets operating for up to 80 years. We are expanding our infrastructure to meet rising demand from electric vehicles (EVs). With commission approvals in the Carolinas and Florida, we’re investing $100 million over the next three years to implement pilot programs that support the decarbonization of the transportation sector. We also joined the Electric Highway Coalition, along with many peer utilities, demonstrating our support of charging infrastructure expansion across the nation’s highways. And we launched eTransEnergy – a new subsidiary that helps companies and cities transition commercial fleets to EVs. We are always improving the grid to meet today’s customer needs. We have over $30 billion of transmission and distribution investments as part of our five-year capital plan. Work continues to further our grid improvement plan in North Carolina and South Carolina. In Florida, we will increase investment under the Storm Protection Plan clause this year, and in Indiana we’ll be working with the IURC and stakeholders to gain approval of our six-year transmission and distribution infrastructure investment plan. Last year, we completed the multiyear installation of more than 8 million smart meters throughout our jurisdictions. And we’re expanding our selfoptimizing grid capabilities. In 2021, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 700,000 extended customer outages, saving customers nearly 1.2 million hours of total outage time. But we cannot overstate the need for emerging technologies. Although we have line of sight to 2030, we still need new, zero-carbon technologies to meet our net-zero goals. We have several partnerships in flight to accelerate these technologies and are evaluating opportunities to build on this work with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding. In the nuclear space, we see exciting progress with several advanced reactor designs in development. We are actively involved with the TerraPower and GE/Hitachi Natrium reactor, which has been selected for the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and includes a molten salt energy storage system. We also participate in several developer advisory boards, including the Holtec executive advisory committee and NuScale industry advisory board.\n",

            "We remain on track to deploy a flow battery, which could potentially store energy for longer periods than current commercial batteries, at our Mount Holly innovation center in early 2023. We are also teaming up with Malta Inc. to study the potential benefits of converting retired coal units into long-duration storage systems. We see promise in hydrogen. We are working with Siemens Energy and Clemson University to perform studies and evaluate hydrogen integration into our generation facility that serves the university. In collaboration with the Energy Futures Initiative and regional stakeholders, we’re looking to advance a Southeast green hydrogen hub centered in the Carolinas. We recognize robust and sustained government support is vital to commercialize these advanced technologies and are advocating for policies to continue to move them forward. Creating sustainable value for customers and shareholders We understand that everything we do must deliver value for our customers and shareholders. For our customers, this means providing affordable, reliable energy but also innovating and transforming the way we do business to better serve them. We began implementing our new billing and technology system – Customer Connect – in 2021 for customers in Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. This platform provides an improved digital experience, new billing and payment options, and more insights to help customers better understand their energy use. These investments have also enabled us to offer new rate designs to our customers. We look forward to delivering this solution to customers in the Midwest this year. To help vulnerable customers, we offered flexibility, including extended payment arrangements and increased efforts to make them aware of payment assistance. We established a dedicated agency team of customer advocates to partner with nonprofit organizations. Through this model, we helped customers receive more than $100 million in financial support to help pay their energy bills. We also assisted lowincome customers with utility bills, providing $3.2 million through the Share the Light Fund and other donations.\n",

            "We improved our J.D. Power results year over year and exceeded our internal customer satisfaction benchmark due to a strong focus on improving the customer experience and delivering on customer needs. For our shareholders, the good news is that our ambitious clean energy transformation is driving growth for the business. In February of this year, we announced that our five-year enterprise capital plan through 2026 will increase to $63 billion – 80% of which represents investments in our grid and fleet transition. We also set our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 – with a midpoint of $5.45 – and extended our longterm EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2026, off the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. We see the potential to earn in the top half of the range as our five-year plan progresses. But value is more than just financial results. We are committed to governance excellence and delivering results the right way. We refreshed our Board of Directors with the recent appointments of five new members, maintaining a focus on diversity of background, experience and perspectives, as well as race and gender. Last year, we conducted a review of our political expenditures and our lobbying policies and processes. We added additional oversight and released the industry’s first Trade Association Climate Report, which disclosed our relationships with trade associations and their positions on climate change. We also updated our Political Expenditures Policy in the fall to incorporate additional disclosures in connection with 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) organizations. In November, we announced a new Sustainable Financing Framework to help fund investments in eligible green and social projects, while providing greater transparency around our investments and our priorities. These efforts helped us earn Labrador Transparency Awards. We were named one of the top three proxy statements nationwide, top utility for overall transparency and seventh among companies for overall transparency.\n",

Duke Energy and its Foundation committed more than $44 million in 2021 to help address the greatest needs in our communities, including $6 million for social justice and racial equity efforts and more than $3 million for pandemic relief. Our teammates and alumni volunteered more than 70,000 hours with nonprofits in our local communities. And our employee-based Power of Giving campaign raised over $5.2 million. Combined with matching funds, this provided nearly $10 million to support over 4,700 area organizations in 2021. We take pride in economic development, helping to recruit new companies to invest and create jobs in collaboration with state and local economic development partners In 2021, we helped attract $6.2 billion in capital investment and created more than 12,500 jobs. Our clean energy transformation will require a highly skilled, agile and diverse workforce, and we are focused on building it, whether that’s creating pipelines of local talent, expanding recruiting outreach or continuing development and agility within our own workforce. Internally, we launched a talent marketplace to help employees pursue short-term opportunities to develop new skills and expand their network, while also helping fill resource needs. Already, over 400 positions have been filled. In 2021, we improved leadership and workforce diversity, expanded training, and built awareness around key diversity and inclusion priorities. Over 6,000 employees and leaders engaged in “Let’s Talk About It” conversations. We are transparent about our diversity journey and are one of just a few in our industry that disclosed Form EEO-1 demographic data last year. Since 2020, our Foundation has committed more than $5 million to promote diverse workforce initiatives. These efforts were recognized externally. We were named one of Fortune Magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies” for the fifth year in a row and to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 16th consecutive year.

            "Eversource Energy completed a very successful year in 2021, providing safe, reliable delivery of electricity, natural gas, and water to 4.4 million customers across New England. Our reliability remained in the top decile of our utility industry peers. We invested $3.5 billion in our energy and water delivery systems to make them more resilient and reliable for our customers. In addition, our above average utility industry performance at preventing serious injuries highlighted our commitment to Safety First and Always. We responded promptly and safely to another year of frequent and intense storm activity and received many accolades from our customers. And we continued to lead the way in supporting the aggressive decarbonization efforts of our states through ongoing implementation of the industry’s #1 energy efficiency programs, making significant progress in the development of our offshore wind projects, and continuing our efforts to make our operations carbon neutral by 2030. Eversource was the first in our industry to establish a 2030 carbon neutrality goal and our 2021 progress toward reaching it included replacing about 125 miles of older natural gas main in Connecticut and Massachusetts, reducing emissions while improving service to customers. We implemented energy-saving efficiency initiatives at our facilities. We now have more than 300 electric or hybrid vehicles in regular service in our fleet. And we worked to advance and support the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Legislation passed in Massachusetts in 2021 creates new opportunities for utility-owned solar investment. Our offshore wind joint venture with Ørsted successfully advanced three projects, totaling more than 1,700 MW of capacity, through the permitting and approval process. We received final approvals for our 130-megawatt South Fork Wind project in January 2022 and have commenced construction. This project will power about 70,000 homes in New York State with clean energy, with completion expected in late 2023. We received all onshore and offshore permits for the redevelopment of New London State Pier in Connecticut, where we are working with the state to transform an underutilized asset into a strategic hub for offshore wind assembly and construction. Eversource and Ørsted announced an agreement to charter Dominion Energy’s 472-foot ship, Charybdis, the first Jones Act-qualified offshore wind turbine installation vessel built in the United States. The vessel, which is expected to be sea-ready by late 2023, will support the construction of Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. We also announced that Sunrise Wind will be the first offshore wind project in the U.S. to use high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology, and our projects will support U.S. manufacturing partners in New York State and Rhode Island. The COVID-19 pandemic that shocked the world in 2020 continued throughout 2021 but did not compromise our service to customers. We continued to work with regulators to offer flexible bill payment options, recognizing the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic, and also collaborated with community agencies to ease the impact of service disconnections as much as possible. Eversource remained focused on safety, adjusting our protocols as needed to best protect employees, customers, and members of the public. We also developed and adjusted return-to-workplace policies that offer flexibility to employees without affecting service to customers. On the regulatory front, Eversource reached a constructive settlement, involving many key stakeholders, of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s (PURA) investigation into our Tropical Storm Isaias response in 2020. We filed a five-year grid modernization proposal in Massachusetts, including implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, and remained active in PURA’s grid modernization dockets, which include advanced metering, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and other technologies. We invested millions of dollars to enable the development of electric vehicle chargers in Massachusetts, including a specific percentage in environmental justice communities. We expect to bring our first battery storage project, on Cape Cod, fully online in the first half of 2022. We worked throughout the year to advance the integration of the former Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets into Eversource after closing the purchase of those assets in late 2020. This acquisition brought immediate benefits to customers and communities, as we stepped up investment in the replacement of older natural gas lines. It also benefited shareholders, as the $1.1 billion acquisition was accretive to our results in 2021. Also, in December 2021, Aquarion, our water delivery business, acquired New England Service Company, adding about 10,000 water customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We emphasized urgent response to storms and emergencies throughout the year, implementing numerous enhancements from lessons learned from previous storms. In general, these upgrades provide more communication and focused information to customers and communities. We’ve also developed ways to work more strategically and effectively with first responders and community leaders. The team responded well to six major and 12 minor Emergency Response Plan (ERP) activations, including an October nor’easter in eastern Massachusetts that caused more than 300,000 customer outages. Our financial performance in 2021 met our stated goals, thanks to our team’s focus on executing our business and investment plans. We provided an 8.2 percent total return to our shareholders in 2021. In addition, our medium and long-term returns remain among the best in the industry. Our total return of 52 percent for the three years ended December 31, 2021 is the 6th best among the 39 companies in the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) index and our five-year return ranks 7th in the EEI index. A significant factor in our strong total return performance is the continued commitment to our common share dividend. In 2021, we raised our dividend by more than 6 percent to an annualized level of $2.41 per share, and in February 2022, our Board of Trustees approved an increase to an annualized rate of $2.55 per share. We continued to advance our focus on diversity, inclusion and social justice, with an ongoing commitment from senior management. These efforts included the launch of an internal Racial Equity Task Force; the ongoing efforts of our employee Business Resource Groups; and awareness activities and events open to all employees. Also, we created a new Vice President-level position focused on equity. Equity means engaging all stakeholders, including our customers and communities, and treating them with respect and dignity while working toward fair and just outcomes, especially for those burdened with economic challenges, racial inequity, negative environmental impacts and justice disparities. By year’s end, we created a 15-member advisory team to develop equity guidelines that will direct our future actions in this area. We take pride in continuing strong support for community agencies at a time when COVID has driven up demand for their services. We held our four signature community events – the Massachusetts General Cancer Center/Eversource Everyday Amazing Race, the Eversource Hartford Marathon, The Eversource Walk for Boston Children’s Hospital, and the Eversource Walk & 5K for New Hampshire Easterseals – in either in-person or virtual formats. We also resumed in-person company volunteer events on a limited basis, keeping safety as our primary focus. We were proud to once again receive recognition for excellence in a variety of areas for our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. These recognitions included: Inclusion in Newsweek’s list of Most Responsible Companies. Inclusion in the JUST Capital list of JUST 100 Companies, a ranking of most responsible publicly traded companies. #1 energy utility and 42nd company overall on Barron’s list of America’s Most Sustainable Companies. The 2021 Gold Medallion Award from the U.S. Department of Labor’s HIRE Vets Medallion Program. This recognizes our excellence in recruiting, employing, and retaining active-duty, reserve and veteran service members. Inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which recognizes companies that have shown their commitment to advancing women’s equality in the workplace and transparency in gender reporting. Recognition as one of America’s “best employers for diversity” by Forbes magazine. Top ratings for sustainability from two leading raters: Sustainalytics and MSCI. A 2021 RIMS Global Enterprise Risk Management Award of Distinction from the Risk Management Society. Eversource was one of three U.S. companies and the only utility to be honored. Very high rankings in several categories of Institutional Investor’s annual investor rankings of utilities, based on a poll of institutional investors and analysts. Finally, we are pleased to report on the continued strength of our succession planning. In May, after five years as CEO, Jim Judge became Executive Chairman and Joe Nolan was elected President and Chief Executive Officer. Joe is a 35-year veteran of the company and has directly overseen our customer service, corporate affairs, energy efficiency, and offshore wind partnership. We are pleased to jointly update you on Eversource’s success in 2021 and bright prospects for 2022 and beyond. We will continue to focus on safe, reliable service; advancing clean energy and reducing carbon emissions; support for social justice, diversity, inclusion, and equity; strong storm response; and COVID safety protocols. With our talented team of 9,200 employees, we are confident that Eversource will respond effectively to every challenge.\n",

            "To Our Shareholders, 2021 was a year of outstanding performance for CenterPoint Energy, led by achieving an important milestone toward the execution of our long-term growth strategy and focus on our core utility businesses. We set clear priorities to invest in the safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and natural gas systems to drive industry-leading growth, while also advancing the transition to a cleaner energy future. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we remain committed to growing our utilities and optimizing the advantages of this growth for our customers, shareholders and communities. We expect to continue to deliver on the following 10-year value proposition: • Achieving our industry-leading long-term annual consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share (non-GAAP EPS) growth target of 8% through 2024 and 6-8% through 2030; • Growing our dividends per share in line with non-GAAP EPS growth over that same period; • Investing in a $40 billion-plus capital program to continue improving the safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and natural gas systems; • Funding our growth with no external equity issuance planned through 2030 by efficiently recycling capital; • Fully exiting our midstream investments no later than December 2022; • Progressing toward our milestones to achieve our industry-leading goal of Net Zero direct emissions by 2035, which is approximately 15 years ahead of our peers’ average; • Maintaining a healthy balance sheet; and • Striving to keep rates affordable for our customers through operations and maintenance (O&M) expense reductions of 1-2% on average annually through 2030, coupled with strong and consistent customer growth. Our Electric business has more than 2.8 million metered customers in the greater Houston area and southwestern Indiana, as well as 1,300 megawatts (MWs) of electric generation capacity in Indiana. We plan to focus nearly half of our planned $23 billion of electric capital on system growth and improvements, including major investments in our transmission and distribution systems. Execution of our strategy in our Electric business includes strengthening our infrastructure and preparing for extreme weather events. Working with regulators and other stakeholders, we have taken steps to harden our transmission system, weatherize and inspect facilities covered by new Texas requirements, and leverage enhanced system load rotation automation technology that we anticipate will allow customers to have more regular and predictable outage intervals should a load shed event occur. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy has entered into a contract for temporary emergency mobile generation for use in certain widespread power outages as allowed by new Texas legislation, and processed more than 100 critical load applications related to the natural gas industry since the winter storm in February 2021. We are working on clean energy investments in Indiana and Texas. With significant coal power plant retirements planned over the next several years, we believe we have a path to successful execution with our renewable investments in Indiana, including our expectation to energize approximately 1,000 MWs by the end of 2024. CenterPoint Energy and the City of Houston recently launched Resilient Now, a first-of-its-kind collaborative framework to develop a regional master energy plan to enhance local power resilience across the greater Houston area. The company will work jointly with individual communities across the area to optimize infrastructure investments and advance energy solutions to address weather-related challenges. The collaborative plan will also create the blueprint for a sustainable future through increased electric transportation and more renewable energy, such as solar and wind. In our Natural Gas business, as our approximately 4.2 million customers in our six-state service territory continue to choose natural gas as their preferred energy source, we are committed to investing in a more modern and resilient network for enhanced safety and environmental performance. To Our Shareholders Execution of our strategy in our Natural Gas business will be driven by a $16 billion natural gas capital plan, the majority of which is focused on modernizing our distribution system by replacing legacy steel, cast-iron and vintage plastic systems, as well as extending new infrastructure to serve the growing populations in our jurisdictions. In fact, our customer base is expected to grow more than 1% per year through 2030. In 2021, our natural gas utility performed in the top quartile of O&M costs per customer among our peers, and we continue to be a top five natural gas utility in number of customers and top three in miles of main pipelines. We anticipate an approximately 33% reduction in methane emissions by 2035 resulting from our pipeline modernization efforts. In Minnesota, we secured passage of the bipartisan Natural Gas Innovation Act in 2021, allowing us to invest in new clean energy resources and technologies to reduce emissions. Our investments also include converting our customer meter infrastructure to help enable automatic and remote shut-off capabilities under certain conditions. While we have used remote-reading capabilities for many years, these new features are designed to enhance the safety and delivery of natural gas to our customers. We expect to have approximately 250,000 customers with these new meter capabilities by the end of 2022. Throughout the year, our employees demonstrated their dedication to our communities. Faced with several natural disasters, our employees answered the call. In February 2021, when severe winter weather impacted much of the nation and a power generation shortfall occurred in Texas, our employees went above and beyond to deliver electricity as soon as it was available and keep the natural gas flowing to our customers. When Hurricane Nicholas approached Texas in September 2021, our employees were ready to support our customers and communities. Following the storm’s landfall, our electric crews restored nearly 300,000 customers in less than 12 hours. Despite Hurricane Nicholas’ impact, we maintained reliable natural gas service to our customers. Our successful performance is a testament to our employees, who validate our values of Safety, Integrity, Accountability, Initiative and Respect through their actions and commitments. We want to express our continued appreciation to them—especially our field and control center colleagues—as they have worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to enable us to safely and reliably serve our millions of customers. In closing, we would like to thank our customers, shareholders and communities for their trust and confidence in us as we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy and focus on our core utility businesses. At CenterPoint Energy, we believe the best is yet to come.\n",

            "\n",
            "During 2020, global oil demand fell by some 9 percent, while natural gas demand fell by a more modest 3 percent.

These disruptions occurred against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and growing economic distress. \n",
            "\n",
            "We demonstrated both resilience and agility in adjusting to extreme market conditions, balancing short-term cash flow and long-term value. Our portfolio is anchored in businesses that are low cost, large scale and long-lived – from our royalty advantaged position in the Permian and growing natural gas business in the Eastern Mediterranean to our feedstock advantaged chemicals business and leading fuels brands on the U.S. West Coast. We expect to deliver results through the business cycle, creating greater value for our stockholders and stronger cash flow for decades. \n",
            "\n",
            "When market conditions deteriorated in 2020, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019. We also reduced operating costs, reflecting our commitment to both capital and cost discipline. In the Permian Basin, we demonstrated our flexibility to cut short-cycle capital. At the same time, we redoubled internal transformation efforts to become more agile, cost efficient and streamlined. \n",
            "\n",
            "In our Upstream business, the acquisition of Noble Energy added complementary high-quality assets in Texas’s Permian Basin, Colorado’s DJ Basin and the Eastern Mediterranean. Portfolio additions in 2020 included approximately 5.67 million net exploration acres. We added 832 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2020, with the largest net additions coming from the Noble Energy acquisition. \n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we advanced construction of the Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan.

            "Fellow shareholders, 2021 was a record-breaking year for our company, marked by significant milestones throughout our business, including the completion of the construction of our initial 9-train platform and the introduction of our comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan. Having delivered on our increased full year EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow guidance, our financial results are the product of the Cheniere team’s relentless focus on execution, supported by fundamental strength in the global LNG market. Throughout 2021, the communities we operate in and serve continued to face challenges from the global pandemic, extreme weather events and unprecedented volatility in the global energy markets. As the title of our 2021 corporate responsibility report, Built for the Challenge, suggests, we maintained our focus on execution and operational excellence throughout the year despite these challenges, upholding our responsibility to provide reliable energy to our customers across the globe and deliver on our promises to shareholders. While we proved resilient in 2020, 2021 showcased the power of the Cheniere platform – we delivered on our increased financial guidance, produced record LNG volumes, and achieved significant execution milestones across our business, generating total returns of over 69% for our shareholders,. With the completion of the construction of our 9-train platform ahead of schedule and within budget, we have successfully transitioned from a developer into the world’s second largest LNG operator, affording our company significant competitive advantages as we leverage our LNG infrastructure platform to pursue disciplined, accretive growth. We strategically managed our operations through volatile global energy markets and gained significant commercial momentum As we closed the door on 2020 and entered 2021, one thing remained constant – volatility in global energy markets. Significant price increases across global gas and LNG benchmarks resulted from a confluence of factors, including higher demand for our product, driven by the need to replenish inventories after a cold winter the year prior, improved economic activity around the world, and the continued structural shift to natural gas as a flexible, cleaner-burning, and reliable source of energy. These conditions were exacerbated by rising coal and carbon prices in Europe, increased weather-driven demand in Latin America, constrained supply from some non-US LNG facilities and lower pipeline imports into Europe. In 2020, stakeholders in our industry were more concerned about security of demand than security of supply. That perspective has been reset by current market conditions, which have created significant tailwinds for long-term contracting of reliable and affordable LNG sources, like our Corpus Christi Stage 3 project. As the LNG market continued to tighten throughout the year, long-term contracting activity accelerated with demand for nearterm volumes predominating. Thanks to the reliability of our operations and the success of our origination and portfolio optimization teams, we were able to tailor LNG solutions to meet the needs of our customers in both the short- and long-term. In 2021, we signed new contracts that will deliver over 80 million tonnes of LNG from 2021 through 2042 to a geographically diverse group of creditworthy counterparties, including Tourmaline, Sinochem Group, Foran Energy Group, ENN and Glencore. These long-term contracts underscore the market’s need for new LNG supply and support our plans to sanction of Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2022. We reinforced our track record for operational excellence and seamless execution Alongside our EPC partner, Bechtel, we completed and placed into service Corpus Christi Train 3 in March and began commissioning Sabine Pass Train 6 in December – both ahead of schedule and within budget. In fact, Sabine Pass Train 6 reached substantial completion in February 2022, over a year ahead of the guaranteed schedule. This accelerated timing once again reflects the world-class standard of execution excellence consistently achieved by the Cheniere and Bechtel teams, and I am proud to have our nine-train platform across Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi completed safely, ahead of schedule and on budget. Since our first cargo in early 2016, we have produced and exported over 2,000 cumulative LNG cargoes, totaling approximately 140 million tonnes of LNG, to customers in 37 different countries and regions around the world. During 2021 alone, we produced and exported 566 cargoes, totaling approximately 40 million tonnes. Having achieved this in just over 5 years is a testament to our team’s commitment to operational excellence, which is a key component of our culture at Cheniere. Since 2017, our operational excellence program has enabled our total run-rate capacity to increase by over 12%, effectively adding another train of production capacity. None of these operational milestones could have been achieved without a focus on safety, which is at the core of our business, as evidenced by our consistent year-on-year improvements in safety since 2018. These achievements, together with a constructive LNG market environment, culminated in four consecutive raises to our full year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA1 guidance and three consecutive raises to our full year 2021 Distributable Cash Flow1 guidance. Because of the success achieved by our teams in terms of execution, operations and financial results, we reached a cash flow inflection point, which enabled us to design a long-term capital allocation plan to deliver value to our stakeholders for years to come. We introduced our comprehensive, long-term capital allocation plan In September we presented our comprehensive “all of the above” capital allocation plan, a strategic financial framework designed to help ensure Cheniere’s long term success by strengthening our financial position, commencing meaningful shareholder returns, and committing to a disciplined approach to deploying growth capital. The capital allocation plan was enabled by our company’s incredible success across our LNG platform over the last 5+ years. With nine trains now complete and operational, representing over $30 billion of capital invested in our LNG platform, we are at the point of significant cash flow generation. Our current forecast calls for ~$14 billion in cumulative distributable cash flow through 2024. The plan to allocate this cash flow was built upon three guiding principles: a strong and sustainable balance sheet, financially disciplined accretive growth and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The plan calls for approximately $1 billion in annual debt reduction until investment grade credit metrics are achieved, steady and meaningful capital returns to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the reset of our 3-year, $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and the commitment to maintaining disciplined growth capital investment parameters that will fund projects with a risk and return profile consistent with our existing 9-train platform. Thanks to the early completion of Sabine Pass Train 6 and the sustained strength of the LNG market, the timeline for achieving our debt reduction goals has accelerated from our initial 2024 target – in 2021, we paid down $1.2 billion of indebtedness, and in 2022, we expect to comfortably exceed the $1 billion target. As part of the capital allocation plan, we paid our inaugural quarterly dividend of $0.33/share on November 17th and repurchased over 100,000 shares for ~$9 million. In terms of growth, we expect to make a final investment decision on Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2022. Reaching the point at which our long-term, fee-based cash flows can sustain a comprehensive, long-term capital allocation plan was a significant milestone for our company and a longtime goal of our management team. We believe our comprehensive capital allocation plan reflects our track record of responsible stewardship of shareholder capital and provides for the long-term sustainability of our business through cycles. We are proud of the platform we have built at Cheniere and look forward to continuing to create and share value with our stakeholders. We significantly advanced our Environmental, Social, and Governance efforts Our achievements in advancing our environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives have positioned Cheniere as a leader among its peers, particularly in data-driven environmental transparency. Since establishing our climate and sustainability principles in 2018, we have made significant progress towards supporting the sustainability of natural gas and securing its role as a long-term reliable form of cleaner-burning energy, supporting the transition to a lower carbon future for our customers and end-users globally. Each of the strategic advances we made in 2021 are built from our foundational climate & sustainability principles. We started the year with the announcement of our Cargo Emissions Tags, which will provide our customers with transparent greenhouse gas emissions data associated with each LNG cargo produced at our liquefaction facilities starting in 2022. These Cargo Emissions Tags are designed to enhance environmental transparency by quantifying the estimated emissions of LNG cargoes from the wellhead to the cargo delivery point. In support of this industry-first effort, we are collaborating with our natural gas suppliers, as well as academic institutions, to develop a robust quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification (QMRV) program to help quantify GHG emissions at natural gas production sites in multiple basins. We also conducted the first shipping emissions study to directly measure methane emissions from an LNG carrier. Our work to measure emissions across our value chain supported the publication of our peer-reviewed LNG life cycle assessment (LCA) in the American Chemical Society Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering Journal, which was the first-of-its-kind in our industry. In 2021, we also published the key findings from our climate scenario analysis, which is an important component of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. The analysis enabled us to better understand the resilience of Cheniere’s existing and future business in various future climate scenarios through 2040. At Cheniere, we lead in accordance with our T.R.A.I.N.S. (Teamwork, Respect, Accountability, Integrity, Nimble and Safety) values and are committed to maintaining a workplace that fosters development and promotes inclusivity. As such, we continue to invest in our core human capital priorities — attracting, engaging and developing talent and advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in our workforce, which we believe helps underpin our current and future success and our ability to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. In 2021, we grew our percentage of women and minorities in management, added two new female directors to our Board and increased the representation of racially and ethnically diverse employees across our workforce. In addition to cultivating a positive environment within Cheniere, we believe building strong relationships with and supporting the communities in which we live and work is fundamental to our success. We focus community development initiatives on local skills training, job creation and targeted community investment. This supports the long-term development of our local communities and builds critical relationships that support our business. In 2021, the Cheniere team gave back to our communities in a variety of ways, providing $4.6 million in direct community giving, 8,000+ hours of employee volunteer time, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in matching gifts and in-kind donations – just to name a few. Included in these achievements, we implemented several new community giving initiatives in 2021. We provided $500,000 in Thurgood Marshall College Fund Scholarships for students at historically black colleges and universities proximate to our operations, partnered with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department to renovate 5 parks in under-resourced communities, contributed $100,000 to the Pathway to Small Business Recovery funding for minority and women-owned businesses in southwest Louisiana, contributed $100,000 towards a partnership with the City of Corpus Christi to address gaps in the homelessness case management process, and provided COVID-19 aid to southwest India in the form of hospital beds and the construction of an oxygen generation plant. I am incredibly proud of what our team accomplished in 2021, and look forward to leveraging our many advantages and delivering significant achievements in 2022. Thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. \n",

            "Dear Fellow Stockholders: We write this year with a sense of excitement as we integrate Devon Energy and WPX Energy following the transformative merger of the companies that closed early this year. The merger is already creating strong momentum for our go-forward company. Our momentum is bolstered by a milestone: This year we will recognize Devon Energy’s 50th anniversary as a company. Our excitement is tempered, of course, by our concern for families, friends and associates amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have navigated the pandemic by focusing on our dual priorities of protecting human health and preserving business continuity. It is with gratitude to our employees and contractors, and their remarkable perseverance over the past year, that we’re able to focus forward with a clear vision to thrive in the energy marketplace. Operationally, the merger expanded and diversified our footprint. Devon operates in the best areas of the best oil and natural gas plays in the United States. We look forward to the ongoing integration of our operating teams and their business processes to increase value. Financially, we’ve begun to capture the synergies that can help us strengthen our leading position among onshore independent E&Ps. And strategically, our disciplined approach to capital spending, in tandem with our demonstrated commitment to returning cash to shareholders through fixed-plus-variable dividends, has set a new standard for our industry. We believe industry-leading performance includes top-tier ESG performance—in the environmental, social and safety, and governance areas. Performance on ESG impacts every aspect of our business, including our social license to operate over the long term. We’re focused as always on progressive corporate governance, including shareholder-friendly practices such as majority voting, proxy access, special meeting rights and de-classified board elections. Once we fully integrate our operations from the merger, one of our top goals is to establish quantitative targets for our environmental priorities, including the reduction of GHG emissions. We have also evolved our approach to executive compensation to further enhance alignment with our stockholders and advanced inclusion and diversity within our corporate culture. The bottom line is this: We are committed to responsible operations to benefit the interests of all stockholders. We respectfully ask for your voting support for the items described in more detail in the materials that follow. Sincerely,\n",

TRANSFORMATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS: Committed to Net-Zero Emissions In 2020, in connection with Ameren Missouri’s Integrated Resource Plan filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission, we established a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all operations. To meet our goals, we’ve made significant investments in renewable energy. In 2021, we saw the first year of operation for our two large-scale wind facilities in northern Missouri, which added 700 megawatts of generation through an approximately $1 billion investment. In addition, we are making significant electric and natural gas investments in other innovative technologies that are transforming the grid, making it cleaner, safer, more reliable, resilient and secure. In addition, our Ameren natural gas distribution systems are comprised almost entirely of polyethylene and protective-coated steel pipelines, with the remaining few miles of unprotected, leak-prone steel pipe replaced in 2021, helping to further reduce methane emissions from our operations. Greenhouse gas reductions will be amplified in Missouri with the planned retirement of our Meramec Energy Center later this year and the expected accelerated closure of the Rush Island Energy Center. In addition, the expansion of solar energy programs offers additional opportunities to grow renewable energy for our customers in both Missouri and Illinois. We have invested more than $3 billion since 2017 in transmission infrastructure, strengthening the backbone of our grid and enabling greater levels of clean renewable energy to be accessed. Throughout 2021, we led efforts to revolutionize transportation through the expansion of electric vehicle charging stations across the Midwest, supporting our own initiatives and national efforts led by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and others. And we further demonstrated our commitment to a sustainable energy future by naming our first chief sustainability officer to help guide these continued efforts. SOCIAL IMPACT: Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Our Business and Communities We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) at our company and in our communities. Though this strong commitment starts at the highest levels of leadership, we expect the entire Ameren team to live our core values, which include respect, teamwork and DE&I. Throughout 2021, we enhanced our DE&I initiatives through successful programs, including our Employee Resource Groups. These multicultural groups are led by our co-workers who support our business goals through year-round community outreach and educational initiatives. We once again hosted a DE&I Leadership Summit for the Ameren team and community leaders featuring local and national speakers, to provide a unique learning and engagement experience. Our industry-recognized supplier diversity program continued to drive inclusive economic growth opportunities for minorityowned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses through diverse supplier spend that totaled approximately $900 million in 2021. In addition, we have once again partnered with the University of Missouri–St. Louis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Accelerator program to put underrepresented entrepreneurs at the center of a purpose-driven initiative, to fuel their creative business models and address the region’s economic disparities. These efforts and more have garnered Ameren several national recognitions, including being named by DiversityInc as the nation’s Top Utility for DE&I in 2021; the EEI Excellence Award for contributions to diverse supplier inclusion and development; as well as being named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index. Investing in Our Communities The pandemic has had a long-lasting impact on the communities we serve. So many families find themselves in unforeseen financial and personal situations. At Ameren, we’ve been working since the onset of the pandemic to provide multiple avenues of support for those struggling economically. Our ongoing efforts include the use of flexible payment plans to assist those facing financial hardship. In addition, we’ve worked with customers to connect them to millions of dollars n energy assistance from state and federal sources and expanded unique company-funded programs, such as Clean Slate in Missouri and Fresh Start in Illinois, to assist those who may not qualify for other assistance programs. We continue to build on our long history of philanthropic support. In addition to supporting donations targeting energy and other assistance programs, the company donated more than $10 million in 2021 to nonprofits focused on addressing critical human needs, advancing wellness in our communities, improving educational opportunities for children and job readiness for young adults, encouraging revitalization efforts to grow the regional economy, and much more. We as a team also contributed our time and talents throughout the year to various volunteer initiatives. These included distributing school supplies to educators from underserved school districts and giving out energy-efficient air conditioners to seniors and people with disabilities to help them stay safe and cool during the summer. Ameren remains focused on serving our communities and giving back to our neighbors in times of need. GOVERNANCE Our steadfast commitment to our corporate values — including integrity — means that we always strive to conduct our business with the highest ethical standards. This is key to our long-range success, and this tone is set at the top by our experienced, engaged board of directors and senior leadership. This diverse group of leaders oversees the pursuit of our strategic objectives and sets a high bar for performance. To ensure ongoing progress, our board of directors has established executive compensation metrics tied to sustainable long-term earnings and dividend growth, operating performance, safety, DE&I and progress toward clean energy goals. These metrics are reinforced by empowering and encouraging all Ameren co-workers to speak up and engage on issues impacting the company, our customers and the communities we serve. Results are important, but more important is how we get them. Guided by an enduring strategy, lasting core values, including a promise to always do business the right way, and a continuous improvement mindset — we will achieve even higher heights together. Delivering SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Our long-term sustainable growth strategy is bringing value to our customers and providing strong results for our shareholders. Ameren is effectively managing billions of dollars of infrastructure investments, working with stakeholders to put in place constructive energy policies and achieve constructive regulatory outcomes. This includes the recent Illinois clean energy and Missouri securitization bills passed in their respective states that we expect will have a positive impact on future investments for the benefit of our customers. Our infrastructure investments, coupled with our disciplined cost management, are delivering results for our customers and shareholders. Our customers experience electric rates among the lowest in the country — well below the national average — and reliability that has improved 12% since 2013. Our weather-normalized earnings per share grew nearly 8% over 2020 results. Since the transition to an all rate-regulated business in 2013, Ameren has delivered weather-normalized core earnings per share growth of 84%, or an approximate 8% compound annual growth rate. Reflecting the confidence of Ameren’s board of directors, we recently announced a more than 7% increase to our dividend, further demonstrating our successful growth strategy — the ninth consecutive year increasing our dividend. For a second consecutive year, Ameren received the total shareholder return Index Award from the EEI as the top-ranking mid-cap company in our industry. This recognition signals successful execution of our strategy to deliver superior customer and shareholder value. Over the next five years, we plan to execute approximately $17 billion in capital projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of our energy grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, and implement new digital technologies and cybersecurity tools. These investments are expected to deliver strong compound annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% from 2022–2026 (using our 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range midpoint of $4.05 as the base).* Looking ahead, we see customer value-enhancing investment opportunities for Ameren totaling more than $45 billion over the next decade to achieve our clean energy transformation. These factors, when coupled with a strong dividend, position Ameren to continue delivering sustainable and superior long-term value. CLOSING Our relentless focus on our customers and the communities we serve has driven our ability to deliver ever-increasing value to them in terms of reliability, cleaner energy, affordability and community service, even during the challenging period we have been operating under for more than two years due to the pandemic. Moreover, execution of our strategy will continue to deliver on a strong long-term sustainability value proposition. For us, being able to lead such a dedicated and committed Ameren team is an honor and humbling responsibility. As we look ahead, central to our success will be keeping our customers at the center of our strategy and our focus on continuous improvement, including: > Our ongoing commitment to Ameren’s strategy and organizational values. > Continuing to enhance customer satisfaction. > Investing in a smarter, more reliable and resilient grid, as well as in cleaner energy resources. > Driving a clean energy transformation in a responsible fashion. > Managing costs to continue keeping customers’ electric and natural gas bills affordable. > Advocating for constructive energy policies to support investment and benefits to our customers. > Supporting regional economic development and electrification. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE DELIVER for our customers and keep them at the center of everything we do, we’ll deliver for you, our shareholders. That’s what we’ve been able to do for many years and will continue to do as we transform for our future together. It’s exciting to work with such a dedicated team that is committed to our mission, To Power the Quality of Life, while successfully executing our strategy and delivering tremendous value to our customers, communities and shareholders. And even more exciting is that this team is well positioned to continue doing so. Thank you for your continued support of Ameren.\n",
