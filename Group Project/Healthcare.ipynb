            "Dear Shareholders, As we publish this Annual Report, Zoetis like many companies is shocked and saddened by the war in Ukraine. As a global community, we are filled with hope for a healthier world guided by our purpose: to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals. In times of crisis, the continued care of pets and livestock remains essential, and we firmly believe this work is core to our responsibilities as colleagues and a business. Our purpose and strong culture of Core Beliefs (see sidebar, p. 3) have guided our success from the beginning. Despite the ongoing challenges of a global pandemic in 2021, we closed the year with a record-setting performance. We grew revenue by 15%—our best year ever—and adjusted net income by 19%, operationally. Importantly, our results demonstrate that animal health medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and devices remain essential, even in times of hardship, and continue to be resilient growth drivers. At the heart of everything we do are dedicated Zoetis colleagues around the world, who are reimagining animal health through innovations that help animals live healthier, more productive lives—and new approaches to support a more sustainable future for communities, animals, and the planet we share. Our strong financial performance has enabled us to continue making meaningful investments in our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. These investments are led by five strategic priorities for growth and are grounded in our purpose. I am pleased to share our progress against our priorities during 2021. 1. Driving Innovative Growth As more people turned to pets for comfort, increased spending on pet wellness and treatment fueled our portfolio and research and development (R&D) pipeline in 2021. During the year, we reported market authorizations for new products and expansions of existing medicines and vaccines in new markets: Our once-monthly chewable combination parasiticide for dogs, Simparica Trio®, has seen tremendous adoption and expanded to new markets in 2021, including Japan and Mexico. In Canada, the EU and the UK, we introduced Librela® and Solensia®, the first injectable monoclonal antibody therapies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats. In early 2022, Solensia was also approved in the United States. In 2021, we also received market authorizations in China for Cytopoint® to treat canine itch, and Revolution PLUS®, a topical parasiticide for cats. In the EU and the UK, we received market authorization for Apoquel® chewable for treating atopic dermatitis in dogs, and authorization in Brazil for our intranasal respiratory vaccine Vanguard® i-III for dogs. In livestock, we continue to invest in R&D that aligns with our customers’ long-term needs for efficient and sustainable production. We expanded Poulvac® Procerta™ HVT-ND vaccine for poultry into new markets, including Brazil, Canada and the Philippines. We also received vaccine approval in certain EU countries for Alpha Ject® Micro 2000 for protection against two bacterial infections in sea bass. In addition, we received market authorizations in the US and Canada for Draxxin® KP, a combination treatment to control bovine respiratory disease and pyrexia. 2. Enhancing Customer Experience Being “customer obsessed” is one of our Core Beliefs and why we seek opportunities that enhance our portfolio and enrich customers’ experiences with their animals. In 2021, we announced an agreement to acquire Jurox, which develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary medicines for treating companion animals and livestock. We expect to close this transaction in 2022. As busy veterinary professionals manage more paws in their clinics, Zoetis is making access to patient information as easy and seamless as possible for them. We introduced our first online portal for presenting user-friendly diagnostic data while improving the connectivity of our systems with various practice information management software. Diagnostics—one of the fastest growing markets in animal health—has great potential for Zoetis, and we continue to invest in giving pet owners the insights and information that their animals cannot tell them. Nothing is more important to our customer experience than reliable, high-quality supply. Our flexible and agile teams enabled us to maintain a steady supply of high-quality products throughout the pandemic. We are also investing in numerous expansions across our supply network to further ensure product inventories in the face of global supply challenges (see sidebar on p. 4). 3. Leading in Digital and Data Expansion of our digital and data capabilities continued to transform the industry by equipping customers with tools and information to help them provide the best care possible for animals, and allowing our teams to better predict inventory needs and to increase efficiency and enhanced collaboration. Our Vetscan Imagyst™ diagnostic platform now offers our veterinary customers a network of expert remote pathologists for cytology diagnostics in addition to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology for fecal testing. We continue to develop additional innovative diagnostic applications to support veterinarians as they care for dogs and cats. Improving engagement with pet owners, our Virtual Recall software is now available in more veterinary clinics and provides tailored communications based on each pet’s quality of life. Today, Virtual Recall is boosting clinic-to-client communications in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. Within Zoetis, we are utilizing data analytics to better predict production and inventory levels and leveraging new AI-driven software to inform customer needs and offer more tailored experiences. 4. Cultivating a HighPerforming Culture Throughout the pandemic, our colleague engagement has remained consistent at 88%, a testament to our heightened focus on well-being, benefit enhancements and embracing a culture of flexibility. Through regular surveys, we continuously listen to feedback to help us strengthen our culture and build a workplace where everyone can thrive. Zoetis is widely recognized as a top employer and a best place to work in several markets. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) is one area where we have made definitive progress. Since setting our DE&I aspirations in 2020, we have been raising the overall representation of Black colleagues, women, and colleagues of color. Our Colleague Resource Groups are expanding communities of interest and allyship within Zoetis and are an integral part of our culture. Our development programs are providing unique career experiences for our colleagues, and our partnerships and close ties to philanthropy allow us to make a lasting impact on the communities where we live and work. Importantly, we are listening more and learning from each other to make Zoetis a place where everyone can bring their whole selves to work. 5. Championing a Healthier, More Sustainable Future Building on our purpose, Zoetis launched its Driven to Care strategy in 2021, which brings to life specific commitments to Communities, Animals and the Planet. The company has committed $35 million over five years through the newly established Zoetis Foundation—focusing on opportunities for veterinarians and farmers globally in the areas of education, wellness and improved livelihoods. Zoetis has played an important role in promoting public health by advancing animal care. In 2021, we were ready when zoos needed to protect their most at-risk animals from COVID. Thankfully, a COVID vaccine has not been needed for cats and dogs. But because of our early scientific work to have an investigational vaccine available, we donated thousands of doses of our COVID vaccine for animals to zoos across 14 countries—and to multiple conservatories, sanctuaries, academic institutions, and government organizations. See our sidebar on p. 2 to learn more about our progress on key environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. The journey ahead In 2022, we see more runway for growth in petcare, diagnostics and fast-growing international markets like China and Brazil. With increasing medicalization and spending on pet health care, we will build on our incredibly strong foundation across parasiticides, dermatology and vaccines to help pets live longer, healthier lives. We also look forward to advancing our pain portfolio for dogs and cats with the anticipation of additional market approvals this year. Our ability to provide new technologies, data-driven insights and other solutions to advance disease prevention and sustainable production methods will further enable us to improve the livelihood of farmers for future generations. As I look to the next stage of Zoetis’ journey, I am inspired by the essential role Zoetis plays in shaping the focus and future of animal health on many fronts. And I know the efforts and insights of our colleagues will continue bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. Thank you for your interest and investment in Zoetis. \n",

            "To Our Shareholders, In 2021, the Zimmer Biomet team remained intensely focused on creating value — despite another challenging year impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am proud to report that we made great progress in the continued transformation of our business and further strengthened our position as a leading medtech innovator. While 2021 brought market pressure, particularly given the proportion of Zimmer Biomet revenues driven by elective procedures, it also presented our company with the opportunity to deliver against our corporate strategy. Zimmer Biomet continued to execute for our team members, for our shareholders and, most importantly, for the customers and patients that we serve. I want to take a moment to thank all of our Zimmer Biomet team members for their unwavering vigilance and dedication to our safety protocols over the past year, and their unmatched focus on our mission to “alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world.” Key Achievements in 2021 Zimmer Biomet continued to drive innovation across the patient journey with our integrated digital and robotics products — all of which help us use data to unlock insights, add value, enhance the user experience and improve patient outcomes. Focused work in active portfolio management, crisis response and planning throughout COVID-19, a commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within the workplace, along with a defined engagement strategy for our team members, were also notable achievements for the company over the course of the year. Highlights of Zimmer Biomet 2021 accomplishments include: • Innovative, Enabling Technologies and Solutions: In 2021, Zimmer Biomet focused on innovation to drive long-term growth. The company delivered multiple robotics launches, debuted the world’s firstand-only “smart” knee implant, offered new functionality with mymobility® and unveiled our ZBEdge™ ecosystem of connected technologies. Active Portfolio Management: We announced and made significant progress toward the spinoff of our Dental and Spine businesses, which was completed ahead of schedule on March 1, 2022. We also accelerated restructuring programs to streamline our operational footprint, offset inflationary pressures in our business, address stranded cost from the spin transaction and create capacity to reinvest in our business. • COVID-19: Prior to COVID-19, Zimmer Biomet developed comprehensive crisis response plans and initiated contingency drills — including for pandemic events — across our operations, which helped prepare our business and create enhanced disaster recovery plans that have been a significant benefit throughout our response to COVID-19. Throughout 2021, we continued to aggressively secure our global supply chain and manage the unique challenges presented by each new COVID-19 wave. Due to these efforts, we continued to keep our team members safe and serve our customers without compromising product quality and safety. • Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Zimmer Biomet further advanced our commitment to creating, supporting and celebrating diverse and equal workplaces and communities. We established year 2026 representation goals for women and people of color (POC) in the organization, guided by internal and external benchmarks. • Team Member Engagement: Through the implementation of a comprehensive engagement strategy, we engaged team members frequently for a more holistic view of their experience as we strive to be a Best and Preferred Place to Work. In 2021, we implemented quarterly performance check-ins, as well as a global, social recognition platform and new, expanded resources to nurture well-being and deliver even greater transparency in our communication for our team members. Our progress during the year was recognized with Zimmer Biomet being named one of America’s Most Responsible Companies 2021 by Newsweek, along with several other awards that highlight our company as a leader in the industry, including PM360’s Trailblazer Award for Best Medical Device Company and inclusion on Forbes’ list of Best Employers for Diversity. The Year Ahead: Moving Our Mission Forward in 2022 I continue to remain highly confident in the Zimmer Biomet team and our business momentum. While some uncertainty due to the global pandemic remains, I truly believe that we are ready and well-positioned for success and that our strategy is absolutely working. The transformation of our business is well underway and I’m excited about the value we can create for our shareholders moving forward. On behalf of all of us at Zimmer Biomet, I thank you for your support. I look forward to continuing to share our progress with you as we move forward.\n",

            "While 2020 brought unprecedented challenges, we are proud to lead an organization that is so deeply rooted in our purpose, so focused on delivering high quality patient care in all of the markets we serve. From the start, the COVID-19 pandemic required us to quickly activate our Crisis Response infrastructure; implement protocols consistent with new (and changing) federal, state and local guidelines; source supplies in quantity and in many cases through new channels; manage staffing challenges; and all the while continue to diagnose and treat patients accurately, efficiently and compassionately. The UHS team demonstrated tremendous agility and determination – remaining focused, resilient and committed to delivering critical care through an evolving environment. They are #HealthcareHeroes, repeatedly praised for saving and improving lives – it’s what they are trained to do and why they chose the profession – although never before put to the test as they have been this year. And never before have they shone so brightly. In 2020, we delivered care to three million patients across inpatient and outpatient access points. UHS generated net revenues of approximately $11.6 billion, an increase of 1.6% over 2019. In our Acute Care business, we completed a number of expansions including adding a new patient tower at Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas; opened three new Freestanding Emergency Departments (FEDs); and continued construction of Northern Nevada Sierra Medical Center, the first full-service hospital to be built in Reno in nearly a century, on-target to open in 2022. We announced a partnership with BAYADA, enabling us to offer home health services through a joint-venture structure in priority markets, leveraging BAYADA’s expertise, reputation and aligned values. In our Behavioral Health business, we opened Canyon Creek Behavioral Health in Temple, Texas and are currently constructing another six de novo facilities, most of which are joint venture partnerships with esteemed health systems well established in their respective markets, with currently unmet demand for behavioral health services. Through our Patriot Support Programs and across our network we cared for and treated over 16,000 members of the armed forces, veterans and family members. We continue to lead the industry in outcomes measurement, this year adding Net Promoter Score (NPS) to our metrics. We celebrated 2020 as the Year of the Nurse, recognizing the vital role Nurses play in providing healthcare services, devoting their professional lives to caring for families in our communities. We thank each and every one of these dedicated caregivers across the UHS enterprise. Heroes, truly. We are proud of the reputation we have earned as a leader in the healthcare industry. For the eleventh consecutive year, UHS was recognized among ‘World’s Most Admired Companies’ by Fortune magazine. We are currently ranked #281 on the Fortune 500 list, and our employees and facilities continue to be honored by national, state and local organizations for delivering high quality care, for pioneering innovation and for their commitment to serving their local communities. Looking ahead, we believe that certain trends accelerated in response to the pandemic are here to stay. For example, Telehealth will further expand and adoption will continue to increase. During COVID-19, one of the silver linings was how quickly we (and others in the Healthcare industry) scaled Telehealth offerings. We believe the trajectory of this channel will continue, as many patients find value in accessing care faster and via the convenience of their mobile devices. While Telehealth will never replace in-person care when indicated, earlier identification of health conditions will accelerate referrals to specialists and hospitals. We also believe that the demand for behavioral health services will increase substantially as the nation continues to combat – and emerge from – the pandemic. Multiple sources reference the toll it is taking on individuals of all ages and demographics; through our network and with our resources, we play a significant role in providing hope and healing. In September, we announced the CEO transition, consistent with our long-standing succession plan. Effective January 1, 2021, Marc assumed responsibilities as CEO and President, with Alan remaining Executive Chairman of the Board. Thank you for your continuing interest, support and investment in UHS. \n",

            "Dear stakeholders, 2020 was a year like no other! Stryker is weathering the COVID-19 storm and continues to be well-positioned for the future. The pandemic’s impact was dramatic in the second quarter and continued thereafter, resulting in our first annual decline in revenue since going public in 1979. However, we did well in keeping our employees safe, serving our customers, and displaying strong financial discipline, including delivering a record year of cash flow. The halting of elective procedures in various geographies around the world was the primary cause for sales declines across multiple divisions and was most strongly felt in our hip, knee, instruments and endoscopy businesses. Our performance continued to outpace our competition but was below our normal expectations given the macroeconomic conditions. Culture and leadership The importance of our mission was reinforced by the pandemic, and, in 2020, together with our customers, we were driven to make healthcare better. Many of our employees went to work on-site every day during the pandemic, to manufacture critical products or support our customers on the front lines of healthcare delivery. Our focus on safety remained a top priority, and in addition to effective COVID prevention measures, we had an excellent reduction in injury rates in our manufacturing facilities. We embraced flexible work practices and employee well-being, and will evolve our ways of working based on our learnings through this challenging time. We continue to be regarded as a great place to work and moved up three spots to #5 in Fortune’s World’s Best Workplaces list. We also received Great Place to Work awards around the world, including in Europe and Asia-Pacific countries. We are making strong progress on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) by empowering our Employee Resource Groups and focusing on inclusive management practices, including a novel, internally developed training program called Think Twice. We had several changes to our Board of Directors this year. We welcomed new board members Lisa M. Skeete Tatum, Founder and CEO of Landit, Inc., and Dr. Giovanni Caforio, Chairman and CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, and we look forward to their contributions. In addition, Roch Doliveux announced that after 10 years of dedicated service, he will not stand for re-election in May 2021 (see p. 12). On our leadership team, Katherine Owen announced her retirement from the Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations role in March, after 13 years of valued service (see p. 14). Financial performance Largely due to the pandemic, our reported sales declined 3.6 percent, our reported net earnings decreased 23.2 percent, and our adjusted net earnings decreased 9.9 percent, while we delivered $3.3 billion of cash from operations which was a 50 percent increase from 2019. As a commitment to our shareholders and our long-term goals we continued to increase our dividend rate, including by 9.6 percent for the January 2021 payment. Innovation, mergers and acquisitions A hallmark of our historic growth record is steady innovation and acquisitions. In November, we closed the largest acquisition in our company’s history, Wright Medical, a fast-growing leader in extremities that will bolster our existing Trauma & Extremities business. We also launched many exciting products, including a wireless Acute Care bed and new product offerings in Neurovascular, Spine and Foot and Ankle. We released updated hip software for our Mako SmartRobotics System, secured regulatory approval for Mako applications in China, Brazil and Russia, and in spite of the pandemic, installed a record number of Mako Systems. Cost transformation We made significant progress in cost transformation and had a strong year in procurement and expansion of our finance shared services. We were challenged in the rollout of our enterprise resource planning (ERP) program, and we intend to resume this program once our operations are stabilized. We also took decisive action to curtail spending due to the pandemic, which contributed to our cash flow performance in the second half of the year. Corporate responsibility We are working to improve healthcare responsibly and sustainably because we believe the health of the world is as important as the people who live in it. We hope you will find the first annual comprehensive report informative, as it outlines our progress and commitments in areas like DE&I and environmental impact, including a carbon-neutral goal for our facilities by 2030. We are committed to delivering positive results for our employees, customers, communities and the planet, and we will measure, monitor and report on our progress. Reflecting on 2020, I am proud of the resiliency our teams displayed, their commitment to our mission and values and our ability to build new capabilities that will serve us well in the future. The Stryker spirit is alive and well, and our people and culture will continue to deliver strong performance in the years ahead.\n",

            "Dear Fellow Shareholders, We are pleased to report that in 2021, we improved performance, grew earnings, enhanced cash flow, and continued to grow our mix of high margin ambulatory care. The results demonstrate a continued positive trajectory despite the hurdles of COVID 19 and other external pressures. It solidifies us as an action-oriented company that has grown earnings and improved margins consistently and is strategically positioned for continued growth and returns further stabilizing and strengthening your company. We are pleased to have the opportunity to share some details about this progress, as well as the steps we continue to take to support a positive trajectory. The primary drivers of our success in 2021 were set into action four years ago as part of an ambitious transformation plan. We remained steadfast in these key fundamental changes that enabled us to perform on a more consistent and sustainable basis as we faced unknown challenges with COVID-19 and other variables throughout 2021. The foundation we have been building allowed the enterprise to maintain a clear and unobstructed vision as it addressed the pandemic while continuing to execute the transformational blueprint. The enterprise, overall, significantly exceeded the expectations of the market, as well as our own expectations allowing us to raise Adjusted EBITDA Outlook a record three times during the year. We also produced significant cash flow in 2021, consistent with the increasing value of the key parts of our business. While these performance statistics are very important, we equally viewed the strategic vision as a guide for our forward steps. We remained focused on the transformation of Tenet into much more than a hospital company, ensuring a more balanced and sustainable economic engine while continuing to provide the most effective and efficient offering to the communities we serve with lower cost ambulatory options. We significantly scaled USPI even further by acquiring ownership interests in 86 ambulatory surgery centers from SurgCenter Development (SCD) and have the exclusive option to partner with SCD on the future development of at least 50 de novo centers over a period of five years. This complements additional ambulatory strategic joint ventures with leading physicians and health systems that continue to form a strong and growing core of USPI. We expect strong returns from these high-caliber investments. Our hospital segment, which we have appropriately trimmed over the last 4 years, remains a leader in acute care driving very strong performance in 2021, with nearly all markets exceeding our expectations for the year. We generated high patient acuity from investments in clinical technology and service line enhancements. Our operators maintained very effective cost management while confronting difficult COVID-related staffing challenges, making real-time adjustments using our analytics platform. We furthered efforts to enhance access to care, including construction projects for new hospitals and medical campuses based on data driven decisions in growth markets and service lines that are needed in these communities. Importantly, we purposely expanded our ecosystem of high-quality physicians across neurosciences, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and other surgical services. Our hospital segment has transformed from average performance to a strong contributor in the enterprise. Our multi-year turnaround at Conifer has resulted in significant margin improvement of over 1,000 basis points since 2017. We continued to build on our progress with revamped commercialization efforts, new sales talent and technology, a focus on point solutions services and efficiencies through our Global Business Center. Based on ongoing shareholder value creation opportunities and improved business fundamentals, we announced on March 1, 2022, that we will no longer pursue a spinoff of Conifer. We believe that building on our progress with Conifer as a part of Tenet will provide greater returns for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are focused on the continued execution at the tactical and strategic levels to continue delivery of additional value to our shareholders. This is centered around five principles: We will stand for high quality, specialty care in the community, continually enhancing services to meet the needs of our communities. We will build upon USPI’s distinctive platform, utilizing unique development and management capabilities to set the bar for high-touch service in ambulatory care settings. We will maintain a commitment to value-based care by delivering new services into the most clinically appropriate, low-cost setting across our acute care hospitals, ASCs, or physician practices. We will continue to attract and retain locally, regionally, and nationally recognized physicians with a shared commitment to excellence in compliance, quality, safety, and patient experience. Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce reflecting the markets we operate in is fundamental to our ongoing success. We believe that we can only achieve our objectives with a high-performance culture. We remain committed to empowering our people, regardless of their role or tenure, to engage in improving our operations with measurable results. And equally ensuring we continue to evolve in offering nurses a vibrant and growing clinical environment to do their work and develop their own skills and competencies. We recognize the need to be purpose-driven in making a positive impact that complements our operational responsibilities built on an overarching goal to create a better, more sustainable path for future generations. We advanced our agenda as it relates to programs that support the key tenets of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and formed a new Board level oversight committee specific to our expanded commitment to the principles embedded in ESG to help meet our goals. Our 2022 ESG report will capture real life profiles of the steps we are taking to foster a diverse and inclusive culture, strengthen the health of our communities, protect the planet, lead with integrity, and apply sound governance. While we have made strong improvements in our Social and Governance areas, including a stronger refreshed and diverse Board of Directors in the last several years, we acknowledge that, while we are not major contributors to environmental risk, we are still actively shaping priorities to improve even further. We are balancing the needs of our patients with the goals of improved climate sustainability and working on the common ground between them ensuring our new facilities meet improved standards in this area while we develop programs to improve our existing operations. Our commitment to improvement and progress remains critical to our continued future success. The Tenet Healthcare of 2021 reflects a stronger, resilient enterprise, that is energized by the opportunities ahead. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our caregivers, whose resolve and commitment define Tenet as an organization. And we equally appreciate the support of our shareholders, our communities, and our partners as we fulfill our mission. We are proud to serve you. \n",

            "DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, When we wrote to you this time last year, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, had recently been declared a global pandemic. Our team had quickly identified ways Regene on could help and had already begun isolating novel antibodies to combat the disease, but no one recognized the epic, world-changing challenges COVID-19 and 2020 would bring. The numbers have been sobering—nearly 100 million people infected globally, several million dead, and almost everyone impacted in some significant wa . The Regeneron team has been deeply impacted as well, from an early outbreak near our headquarters in Westchester, New York, to the personal loss of loved ones. Despite this unprecedented public health crisis, 2020 was an inspiring year in many ways, demonstrating the power of science and the resilience of our team. We discovered, developed and manufactured our novel REGEN-COV™ (casirivimab with imdevimab) antibody cocktail treatment for COVID-19 in record time—just 10 months from program inception through an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To date, tens of thousands of patients have received REGENCOV, and we are now working in partnership with the U.S. government, healthcare providers and advocacy groups to ensure all appropriate patients can access it. Unlike vaccines, which trigger the body’s own immune response to protect against infection, REGEN-COV provides virus-neutralizing antibodies directly to the patient. In the pivotal Phase 3 treatment trial, REGEN-COV reduced hospitalization or death by 70 percent in high-risk outpatients and reduced symptom duration. As we do our part to bring this pandemic to an end, we continue to evaluate REGEN-COV in additional patient populations, at lower dose levels and for prevention purposes. To that end, results from the Phase 3 prevention trial showed that REGEN-COV administered as a subcutaneous injection reduced the risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections by 81 percent among household contacts of infected patients. As of April 2021, more than 25,000 people have participated in clinical trials of REGEN-COV, and we thank all the individuals, investigators and collaborators. Our financial position emained strong this year, with top-line growth of 30 percent and bottom-line growth of 28 percent1 through an increasingly diversified set of evenue and earnings streams. Total revenues for 2020 increased to $8.5 billion, compared to $6.6 billion for the full year 2019. EYLEA® (aflibe cept) Injection continues to reach more patients in competitive eye disease markets, with its efficac , safety and convenience setting a high bar for current and potential future entries. We are confident in the durability and continued growth of this important medicine for years to come. Annual EYLEA global net product sales reached nearly $8 billion in 2020 (net product sales outside the U.S. recorded by our collaborator Bayer), and $4.9 billion in the U.S., still without a single price increase in its history. Looking to the rest of our growing portfolio, more than 80 percent of our top-line growth in 2020 came from products and revenues other than EYLEA. Dupixent® (dupilumab) global net product sales in 2020 (recorded by our collaborator Sanofi) we e more than $4 billion, reflecting g owth of 75 percent versus 2019. This “pipeline in a product” continues to reach more patients in need with an expanded FDA indication for atopic dermatitis in patients ages 6 to 11 and an FDA acceptance of our supplemental application as an add-on treatment for children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, with even more room to grow as it meets its potential to transform the treatment of certain type 2 inflammatory diseases. e also made Dupixent treatment more convenient with the FDA approval of a single-dose, 300mg prefilled syringe As the foundation of our oncology portfolio, our PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) is achieving significant and steady g owth with FDA approvals in two new indications, non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, in early 2021. Global net product sales for Libtayo were $348 million in 2020, representing 80 percent year-over-year growth. We are making progress in other cancers as well, including in March 2021 when positive results in overall survival prompted us to stop our cervical cancer trial early, with the data forming the basis of upcoming regulatory submissions. With 11 investigational therapeutics in clinic for a wide range of cancers, including eight bispecific antibodies we continue to diversify our approach to oncology and are positioned to lead the next wave of innovation in immuno-oncology. Our COVID-19 program and other important progress this year was made possible by decades of investment in our foundational VelociSuite® antibody discovery and development technologies, as well as in world-class manufacturing enterprise. Thanks to these investments and the hard work of our colleagues, in 2020 and early 2021 we achieved two new FDA-approvals of novel, Regeneron-discovered antibody medicines: the multi-antibody cocktail Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimabebgn) for Ebola, and the ANGPTL3 inhibiting antibody Evkeeza™ (evinacumab-dgnb) for a rare form of inherited high cholesterol. Regeneron is known for our science-driven approach, and as such our pipeline and research efforts continue to expand. We continue to reinvest a significant portion of our growing revenue into our R&D efforts to fuel the remarkable innovation and curiosity of our world-class team. Our early pipeline is increasingly powered by genetics, thanks to significant insights f om the Regeneron Genetics Center®, which reveals new targets for exploration as well as enriching current clinical programs. Our genetics medicine efforts also include important collaborations with Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which pair Regeneron’s biologic and antibody capabilities with cuttingedge technologies like CRISPR gene editing and RNA silencing. Both of these partnerships advanced candidates into clinical development for the first time in the past yea . While 2020 tested us in new ways, we are proud to say that the Regeneron team successfully advanced our mission of using the power of science to bring new medicines to people in need. We came together as never before. Watching our employees rally to support each other was awe-inspiring, as was the strong spirit of collaboration and pride in our collective purpose. We head into this next year with the confidence that we will continue to tackle some of the world’s biggest health and scientific challenges.\n",

We are using our vaccine expertise in an effort to tackle tickborne illnesses such as Lyme disease and expanding our mRNA platforms to study the potential of the technology in helping to prevent flu and shingles, and to treat rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system.

            "\n",
            "During 2021, we also further enhanced our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. Pfizer’s ESG strategy is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. We made great strides in each of these areas last year, and I would like to share three examples. First, Pfizer last year published an industry-first retrospective analysis of demographic data of U.S. participants in 213 of our interventional clinical trials that initiated enrollment from 2011 through 2020. The analysis demonstrated that overall trial participation of Black or African American individuals was at the U.S. census level (14.3% vs. 13.4%), participation of Hispanic or Latino individuals was below U.S. census (15.9% vs. 18.5%), and female participation was at U.S. census (51.1% vs. 50.8%). Our goal is to achieve racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above U.S. census or disease prevalence levels (as appropriate) in all our trials. Second, Pfizer has made significant progress in diversifying our colleague base, particularly at more senior-level positions. In the last three years, for example, we have increased the percentage of women at the vice president level and above globally from 32.3% at the end of 2018 to 41.5% at the end of 2021. Over that same timeframe, we have increased the percentage of minorities at the vice president level and above in the U.S. from 18.8% to 25%. Third, we continue to make progress in helping to ensure our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment are accessible by everyone everywhere. I am thrilled to say that we remain on track to meet or exceed our goal of delivering at least two billion doses of our vaccine to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022 – having just met our goal of delivering the first one billion by the end of 2021. In terms of our oral COVID-19 treatment, we have signed a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), which we hope will lead to expanded access, pending country regulatory authorization or approval, in 95 low- and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the world’s population. \n",

            "Looking ahead, Pfizer is well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful value for patients, investors and all stakeholders. This confidence is underpinned by the momentum of our business, the expected durability of our COVID-19 offerings, the strength of our internal R&D pipeline (which as of February 8, 2022 consisted of 89 potential new therapies and indications with 10 programs in registration and 27 in Phase 3 clinical trials), and, of course, by our ability to deploy capital into growth-focused business development to access external science. In summary, 2021 saw Pfizer further cement its standing as a scientific and commercial powerhouse capable of taking on the world’s most devastating diseases. In a year of unprecedented challenges, we realized unprecedented achievements. We are grateful to the colleagues, clinical investigators, research institutions, partners, and, of course, patients who have made these breakthroughs possible, and we look forward to many more successes in the year ahead. \n",

            "The year 2020 put life insurers to the test. We faced an unrelenting global pandemic with severe excess mortality, the lowest interest rates in U.S. history, and extreme market volatility. The intense pressure of this environment was either going to expose brittleness or reveal strength. At MetLife, we emerged from the crucible tempered with greater confidence that we have the right strategy, the right businesses, the right culture, and the right team to create long-term value. \n",

            "Our Purpose in Action \n",
            "\n",
            "We believe the foundation for our success is grounded in our purpose, Always with you, building a more confident future. That purpose is a virtuous circle: We create long-term value for shareholders by empowering our people to deliver for our customers and communities. It begins, as always, with our people. During the pandemic, we needed to step up for our employees more than ever to help them feel safe, informed, engaged and inspired. We enhanced medical benefits to cover testing and treatments for COVID-19, paid for safe transportation alternatives for essential employees, and expanded mental health resources. With most of our people isolating at home, we knew they were hungry for connection, so we decided to launch virtual all-employee town halls every other week. I’ve hosted 23 since last April. As a leadership team, we believe there is a clear link between employee engagement and company performance. In 2020, our global employee engagement scores rose significantly. Across the enterprise, every score went up, every score landed in the “good” or “very good” category, and every score was above the benchmark where one was available. On a survey where a two-point move is considered the marker for culture change, we improved by more than that in the three areas we believe will contribute the most to future growth – collaboration, customer focus, and experimentation. Inspired by our purpose, our people went above and beyond for our customers in 2020. The pandemic dealt a terrible blow to many of the places where we do business. We quickly pivoted to work-from-home to maintain service levels, waived pandemic exclusions, extended grace periods, and granted more than a quarter billion dollars in relief between premium credits and charitable giving. Caring for our customers means more than grand gestures. It means doing whatever we can in our own capacity to help. Early in the pandemic, one of our sales agents in Korea, Sung-deok Choi, was alarmed by her country’s shortage of masks. A seamstress by hobby, she made a hand-sewn mask for herself that prompted a customer to ask how he could get one. In that moment, she decided to make one for every customer she met. Just one small act of kindness among the thousands our employees performed. Of course, one of the most vital roles we play is simply by fulfilling our obligations as a life insurance company. The pandemic was not just a health crisis. It was a financial crisis. At a time when jobs were vanishing and markets were reeling, we kept our promises, paying out approximately $30 billion in claims and benefits in 2020 to help restore a modicum of financial stability. This is what life insurance companies are for. \n",

            "Despite an unprecedented combination of challenges, MetLife came through 2020 in remarkably strong shape thanks to a sound strategy and consistent execution. The “Focus” pillar of our Next Horizon strategy directs us to allocate scarce resources and capital to their highest and best use. At MetLife, this has meant a sustained effort to improve the risk profile of our business. In 2020, we demonstrated that we are a less interest-rate sensitive company. Even with the 10-year Treasury stuck below 1 percent for most of the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity of 12.3 percent.i No less important was the highly diversified nature of our risks. This was evident across our businesses – mortality offset by longevity; morbidity outweighed by lower utilization; weakness in Latin America countered by strength in Asia and EMEA; and lower recurring investment income significantly exceeded by the positive earnings impact of volume growth. The advantages of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy are never clearer than when conditions are the most turbulent. Two other noteworthy contributors drove our strong financial performance in 2020 – variable investment income (VII) and expense discipline. On VII, MetLife’s decision to invest approximately 2 percent of our portfolio in private equityii once again proved its worth. This asset class delivered exceptional returns in 2020, boosting VII $226 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. We have an equally strong story on expense discipline, where we delivered a direct expense ratioiii 30 basis points below our target of 12.3 percent. Year over year, this generated enterprise-wide savings of approximately $300 million. All of these elements – reduced exposure to interest rates, strong diversification, expertise at sourcing private assets, and operational rigor – led to significant value creation in 2020. Adjusted earnings per share excluding notables were up 5.3 percent. Book value per shareiv was up 10.6 percent. And cash generation was robust – we ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company, well above the top end of our target buffer. This cash buffer comes after the deployment of approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases, and accretive M&A, and the investment of approximately $3 billion to support new business growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have heard 2020 referred to as a “lost year.” For MetLife, it was anything but. Our strong performance means we remain on track to deliver on our five-year Next Horizon commitments. And we continue to seize the opportunities in front of us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Our U.S. Group Benefits business is a case in point. While we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space, we are deepening our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits through acquisition or partnership – digital wills, health savings accounts, and pet insurance. In 2020, we acquired Versant Health to propel us into the top tier of vision care providers in the U.S. And in the first half of 2021, we sold our property and casualty business to Farmers Insurance and established a strategic partnership through which Farmers will offer personal lines products to approximately 37 million eligible employees on our platform. \n",

            "Sustainability is at the very heart of how we run our business at MetLife. That’s how we’ve been able to keep our promises for more than 150 years. Yet we also realize that the expectations of companies continue to rise. We are striving to advance across all dimensions of the ESG framework. On the environment, for example, we had set a goal of reducing energy use and location-based greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 10 percent between 2012 and 2019. Having significantly exceeded that goal – GHG emissions fell by 27 percent – we set 11 new goals for 2030. I will highlight just a few:\n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve committed to maintain carbon neutrality while reducing our locationbased GHG emissions by an additional 30 percent.\n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve pledged to originate $20 billion in new green investments and to make $500 million in new impact investments, 25 percent of which will address climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "And we’ve allocated $5 million toward products and partnerships that drive climate solutions. \n",
            "\n",
            "More broadly, MetLife helped advance the market for sustainable financing in 2020 by issuing the U.S. insurance industry’s first “green” funding-agreement-backed note – a $750 million issuance that will support environmental improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the social component, MetLife is a company that deeply values diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). We are strengthening our resolve to help build a workforce and society that protects all people and values all voices. Violence against Black and Asian communities shows us how much work we still have to do to achieve racial justice. At MetLife, we need to continue speaking out, supporting groups working for progress, and doing better at advancing women and ethnically and racially diverse (ERD) employees within our own ranks. On workforce diversity, our goal is to be a leading financial company with top-quartile performance as measured against best-in-class industry benchmarks. We make diverse slates of candidates a key component in filling senior leadership roles. We train all of our recruiters to mitigate bias in hiring. And we hold our people managers accountable for cultivating an inclusive workplace. Globally, women now represent 52 percent of our workforce, 42 percent of managers, 30 percent of our Executive Group, and 33 percent of our Board of Directors. In the U.S., ERD employees make up 18 percent of our salesforce, 29 percent of our non-sales employees, 36 percent of our Executive Group, and 16 percent of our Board of Directors.v Our programs are showing progress. For example, we have a 14-month leadership program to advance women into officer-level positions. To date, 22 percent of participants have been promoted to vice president within two years, which is three times our global rate. We also launched a talent stewardship program called “Excelerate” to advance ERD employees into officer-level roles. The program began in the fall of 2020, and of the 18 participants so far, 67 percent have been women of color. To help build a stronger pipeline, we work with a number of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and in 2020 we provided $1 million to the UNCF to finance scholarships at HBCUs. To hold ourselves accountable for making continued improvement, last year we became the first U.S.-based insurer to sign the U.N. Women’s Empowerment Principles. The seventh principle is, “Measure and publicly report on progress to achieve gender equality.” We do this by releasing granular public information about the make-up of our workforce so that our performance can be tracked. We also endorsed the COVID-19 5-Point Action Agenda, which commits us to promoting inclusion in the workplace. This commitment to transparency and accountability applies more broadly as well. In 2020, we took steps to enhance our ESG reporting capabilities by leveraging the three frameworks considered the most robust: the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, and the Global Reporting Initiative. Sustainability is not merely central to MetLife’s purpose. It is central to how we execute on our strategy. We compete every day for talent, customers, and capital. We believe companies that outperform on sustainability will have a competitive advantage in recruiting the best people, meeting and exceeding the expectations of their customers, and attracting investors who want their capital to have a positive impact.\n",

We know we can be more efficient – our new flex-work model should produce both cost savings and stronger employee engagement. And we know we can be more agile – if there is one facet of our culture that has changed more than any other, it is our sense of urgency. This last point bears emphasis. Having the right strategy is not enough. Having a strong year is not enough. I can assure you that as a management team, we will never rest on our laurels. Consistent execution is our new expectation; continuous improvement our new aspiration. As I embark on my third year at the helm of MetLife, I feel more privileged than ever to lead this great institution.

Our nearly 14,000 associates remained steadfast in our mission to improve the health and lives of the more than five million members we serve by delivering high quality, affordable healthcare. Their passion was unwavering and directly responsible for driving success across the enterprise, from serving our existing members to growing our business in existing states and winning business in new states. We continue to execute our sustaining profitable growth strategy. Year over year we generated 47 percent premium revenue growth that was well balanced between organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. Our earnings per share exceeded our initial guidance despite a higher than expected net effect of COVID. Our after-tax margin, excluding the transitory impact of the net effect of COVID, was squarely in line with our long-term targets. We announced the acquisitions of AgeWell in New York and of the Medicaid business formerly owned by Cigna in Texas, for combined incremental premium revenue of $1.7 billion. We closed the acquisition of Affinity Health Plan and continued to successfully integrate Passport Health and Magellan Complete Care. On the Medicaid procurement front, we re-procured our Ohio contract and were awarded a new state contract in Nevada. I am pleased with the momentum we created with our operational and financial successes during 2021. Turning to the future, we are committed to staying close to the core as a pure-play government-sponsored managed care company.

In fact, we have successfully weathered the pandemic so far. That’s because the strengths of our business model with three innovation-driven business sectors have become particularly evident during the Covid-19 crisis.

We gained further approvals around the world for Mavenclad®, our oral multiple sclerosis therapy. It is now registered in more than 80 countries globally, including the European Union, the United States, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. Both products made an increasingly larger contribution to organic sales growth in Healthcare. In addition, our oncology precision medicine Tepmetko® (tepotinib), which was developed in-house, was approved in Japan. It is thus the world’s first oral MET inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced lung cancer with MET gene alterations to receive regulatory approval. However, this business sector was temporarily strongly impacted by Covid-19, especially the Fertility franchise.

            "And as countless people around the world work from home and practice social distancing, our high-tech materials are critically important to the electronic equipment and devices that bring people together virtually.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are proud to note that in all our businesses and functions, we are helping both directly and indirectly to meet the global challenges posed by Covid-19. Whether through financial contributions or by donating masks and disinfectant, we have been providing support in the regions and cities in which we operate worldwide.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet, also in terms of business, we performed very well overall in 2020, despite considerable pandemic-related obstacles in some businesses. Once again, we generated growth. Group sales rose to a total of € 17.5 billion, growing by 8.6% over 2019. And EBITDA pre, the most important financial indicator to steer our operating business, amounted to € 5.2 billion, a year-on-year increase of 18.6%. EBITDA pre was positively impacted by income from the release of a provision of € 365 million for potential damages relating to patent litigation with Biogen Inc. USA (Biogen). Earnings per share pre (EPS pre) increased by 20.5% to € 6.70.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a year marked by a pandemic, these positive results should not be taken for granted. First and foremost, they are thanks to the engagement, the perseverance and the unabated passion for innovation shared by our global workforce of over 58,000 employees. On behalf of the entire Executive Board, I would like to warmly thank them for their extraordinary commitment last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our positive business performance in 2020 was also reflected in the capital markets. For the first time in German stock market history, we became the company with the highest market capitalization in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This is superb recognition of our development and strategic direction. In addition, we also celebrated the 25th anniversary of our listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n",
            "\n",
            "As shareholders, you are also benefiting from this. In 2020, our share price increased by 33%. The dividend reflects this growth as well because, in line with our sustainable dividend policy, we focus primarily on the development of the Group’s earnings. Consequently, we will propose to the Annual General Meeting the payment of a dividend of € 1.40 per share for fiscal 2020 – 10 cents more than in the previous year.\n",

            "We can be very satisfied with how well we made it through the “crisis year 2020”. At the same time, we must set our sights on the future. We want to drive our transformation to become the leading science and technology company forward. That is why we have set ourselves clear priorities for 2021.\n",
            "\n",
            "Being a global supplier of innovative specialty products – that is and remains our strategy in Healthcare. An important priority will be to further drive the profitable growth of our core General Medicine, Endocrinology and Fertility franchises, particularly in China. We will focus also on realizing the commercial potential of Mavenclad®, Bavencio® and Tepmetko®. We want to further unlock the possibilities of our pharmaceutical pipeline – while at the same time operating efficiently in order to meet our ambition for the future. At the beginning of 2021, we welcomed Peter Guenter as a new member of the Executive Board with responsibility for the Healthcare business sector. He has many years of experience and superb knowledge of the international pharmaceutical sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Life Science, we are aiming to further expand our strong positions in Process Solutions and e-commerce. To achieve this, we must resolutely realize new growth opportunities, for instance in genome editing and novel modalities, end-to-end bioprocessing and connected laboratories. At the same time, we are doing everything possible to meet the increased demand for our life science products in these unprecedented times. Together with the global Life Science team, Matthias Heinzel will be building on our previous successes. He will become a member of the Executive Board of our company on April 1, 2021, assuming responsibility for the Life Science business sector.\n",

            "In Electronics, formerly Performance Materials, we remain committed to further expanding our leading position as an innovation partner. We are the company behind the companies, advancing digital living. To this end, we aim to grow while securing stable margins, especially in businesses with materials and solutions for the semiconductor industry as well as with organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). We are therefore pushing forward with the execution of the five-year Bright Future transformation program.\n",

            "In all these efforts, we will run our business as a good corporate citizen. For us, scientific progress and responsibility go hand in hand. Responsible and sustainable conduct with respect to employees, products, the environment, and society is a fundamental prerequisite for our business success. That is why we specified the following goals in our sustainability strategy: In 2030, we will achieve human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable science and technology. By 2030, we will integrate sustainability into all our value chains. And by 2040, we will achieve climate neutrality and reduce our resource consumption. These are ambitious goals. However, we are convinced that we can reach them and contribute in this way to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate impact mitigation, resource scarcity and a pandemic are major societal challenges that can be solved only through broad-based collaboration. In particular, the search for a Covid-19 vaccine has made clear how important it is for research, business and decision-makers from the political sphere to pull in the same direction. International cooperation is the order of the day; multilateralism is the answer to economic standstill. Simultaneously, the crisis is acting as a catalyst for new-found trust in science. Widespread skepticism is giving way to greater openness and mutual respect. As a science and technology company, we can and must seize these opportunities to enable social progress.\n",

Our actions are shaping human progress: We are developing innovative therapies, working on the biotechnology of tomorrow and enabling the digital revolution. This is something I have experienced every day for the past ten years. My time at our company will be over at the end of April 2021. On May 1, Belén Garijo will succeed me. We have worked together successfully for the last ten years. The company is in very good hands with her. It was a special honor for me to lead this unique company. And I firmly believe that our company is excellently-positioned for sustainable and profitable growth – and will also remain committed to progress in the future.\n",

            "Dear Shareholder, It is my pleasure to invite you to join us for the 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting of Labcorp, being held on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 2022 Annual Meeting will be webcast live at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LH2022 during which time you will be able to vote your shares electronically and submit questions. 2021 was a historic year for Labcorp. By harnessing the power of science, technology and innovation, we continued to carry out our mission. We dedicated significant resources to fight COVID-19, quickly brought innovations to market, and advanced each pillar of our company strategy, which led us to deliver robust financial performance. We demonstrated remarkable leadership in the fight against COVID-19, continuing to leverage Labcorp’s comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, identify and monitor new variants, and advance vaccine and therapy development. The pivotal role we play in society as a source for health answers was underscored by the implementation of our new brand. We are delivering vital information to help our customers and patients make clear and confident decisions that improve health and improve lives. In 2021, we generated $16.1 billion in revenue with $3.1 billion in operating cash flow, $2.6 billion in free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures), diluted earnings per share of $24.39, and adjusted earnings per share of $28.521, representing notable growth from 2020. We deployed capital wisely, with a total of $2.5 billion invested in share repurchases, acquisitions, and debt pay down. We continued to see the recovery of our base business (operations excluding COVID-19 testing) throughout the year. Although we anticipate that revenue from COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing will significantly decline through 2022, we believe we are positioned well for continued growth in our base business. As we effectively navigated global challenges related to the pandemic, we made great progress in 2021 across our key strategic priorities. We made significant headway as a leader in oncology by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities. We intensified our customer focus and embedded technology and data throughout our business. We also pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long-term and high-growth potential, including acquisitions such as OmniSeq, Ovia Health, Myriad Autoimmune’s Vectra test, and Toxikon, as well as strategic collaborations with hospitals and health systems. In all of our strategic focus areas, we leveraged our unique set of capabilities to accelerate our business and produce strong results. In 2021, management and the Board of Directors, working with outside advisors, thoroughly reviewed our company’s structure and capital allocation strategy. As part of the comprehensive review of our structure, we held extensive conversations with third parties and the Board considered a wide range of options, including significant acquisitions, divestitures, and spinning off businesses, as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners. The Board unanimously concluded that the Company’s existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time and represents compelling opportunities to grow and create significant shareholder value. Following the conclusion of the review, the Company announced actions that the Board of Directors and management team are taking to further enhance shareholder value: • Initiate a dividend in the second quarter of 2022. The Board is targeting a dividend payout ratio of between 15-20 percent of adjusted earnings; • Authorize a $2.5 billion share repurchase program. As part of this program, $1 billion is being repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase plan; • Implement a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, targeting savings of $350 million over the next three years; • Provide a longer-term outlook in connection with the announcement of Labcorp’s 2021 year-end results in addition to the Company’s annual guidance; and • Provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures beginning with Labcorp’s first quarter 2022 results. Moving forward, we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation, and new technology. As we execute on our strategy, management and the Board will continue to evaluate avenues for enhancing shareholder value. Last year, we also undertook a number of employeebased actions to make a meaningful difference for employees and to help us be a more competitive and a preferred employer in the marketplace. We focused on the importance of fostering diverse and inclusive teams to drive innovation and meet customer needs. These actions were taken with the support of the Board and will continue as our focus this upcoming year for our workforce of over 75,000 people around the world. Our long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance practices remains an important component of our success. These practices provide an important framework within which our Board and management pursue the strategic objectives of Labcorp and ensure the Company’s long-term success for the benefit of our shareholders. As part of our ongoing shareholder engagement efforts, in 2021 senior management engaged with shareholders representing more than 80 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares. Discussions with our shareholders were primarily focused on a review of our performance and differentiated capabilities, our progress in executing on our strategic priorities as a leading global life sciences company, our corporate governance practices, including refreshment, diversity, human capital management, cybersecurity and enterprise risk management, sustainability, and our executive compensation program. We value our shareholders’ input and we continuously strive to increase our level of shareholder engagement, including by involving members of the Board in meetings with our largest shareholders. Feedback from these meetings is regularly reported to the full Board to ensure all directors have the benefit of our shareholders’ perspectives. Our shareholder engagement includes input on our executive compensation, which is incorporated in the Compensation and Human Capital Committee’s annual review of our compensation program. Our compensation program is designed to create strong alignment between our executives’ pay and the performance of the company. We are committed to the continued refinement of our compensation program to better reflect successful execution of our strategy and the expectations of our shareholders. The Board of Directors believes our current compensation program, which is focused on performancebased and variable compensation, achieves this objective. At the 2022 Annual Meeting, we will ask you to (1) elect ten director nominees named in the attached proxy statement to our Board of Directors, (2) approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, executive compensation, (3) ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2022, (4) vote upon one shareholder proposal, and (5) act on any other business matters properly brought before the meeting. We invite you to review the detailed information beginning on page 33 about the skills and qualifications of our director nominees and why we believe they are the right people to oversee the long-term performance and overall success of our company; and our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which begins on page 46. We value your vote. Whether or not you plan to participate in the 2022 Annual Meeting, it is important that your shares are represented and voted at the meeting. I urge you to promptly vote and submit your proxy via the Internet, phone, or, if you receive paper copies of the proxy materials by mail, by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. The world is completely different than it was two years ago when I joined Labcorp as CEO. We have been on a challenging journey that has given our company and our employees the chance to demonstrate our mission like never before. The steps we are taking advance our vision for our company and position Labcorp to play an even greater role in defining the future of global health care while delivering strong returns for investors. Our work throughout the pandemic is a case study in the potential of our unique capabilities to innovate and develop game-changing health solutions. It also highlights the many compelling growth opportunities we can realize. We have a clear path to continue to advance our strategic objectives and unlock greater shareholder value. I am incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished and feel that the future has never been brighter for Labcorp. On behalf of Labcorp’s management and the Board, I thank you for your investment in Labcorp. We look forward to your participation during the 2022 Annual Meeting. \n",

            "At the start of 2020, no one could have imagined just how dramatically our world was about to change due to a virus that has impacted billions of people in every nation. By any measure, it was a year dominated by uncertainty—yet the pandemic helped to clarify our priorities and reinforce our values. And while the familiar yard signs may be faded now, their message is more resonant than ever: We’re all in this together.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because of COVID-19, we all have a profound new appreciation and gratitude for the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff serving on the front lines of care, and for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up 24/7 to keep the world’s critical healthcare infrastructure up and running. Expectations that companies must drive positive change on behalf of everyone—no matter who you are, or where you live—are higher than ever. And we were all served an important reminder about just how central good health is to our collective prosperity, our security, and our society at the most fundamental level.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nothing is more essential to every person, every family, every town, and every nation on earth than health. Whether COVID-19 touched you directly or indirectly, no individual’s life was left unchanged by the pandemic—and together we gained a shared understanding of a universal truth: No one is safe until everyone is safe.\n",

            "\n",
            "In early January 2020, it was impossible to guess exactly how the nascent pandemic would unfold. But Johnson & Johnson has been investing in and applying the best science to take on the most serious public health threats for more than a century—and there was never any question that we would contribute the full breadth and depth of our company’s expertise to global efforts to combat COVID-19.\n",
            "\n",
            "“As the world’s largest and most broadly-based healthcare company, we have both a unique perspective on global health and a profound responsibility to lead when called. As soon as the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus was made available, our role was clear even though success was anything but guaranteed: We at Johnson & Johnson would do everything in our power to develop a safe, effective, and efficient vaccine for the largest number of people around the world.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“With this ambitious, urgent goal driving us forward, we set out to follow the science and to make our potential vaccine available on a not-for-profit basis for pandemic emergency use.\n",
            "\n",
            "This work was done around the clock, through innovative models of public–private partnerships and new heights of purpose-driven collaboration. In the face of both successes and challenges, we continually affirmed our commitment to safety, scientific integrity, and transparency. And exactly one year after we officially began the development process, we were able to share positive top-line results from our Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial for our company’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. Shortly after, based on the totality of scientific evidence, we received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our single-dose COVID-19 vaccine and immediately began shipping doses in the U.S.\n",
            "\n",
            "This monumental achievement will be an enduring point of pride for us for decades to come. Perhaps most remarkable of all: The successful development of our COVID-19 vaccine was only one of the many incredible accomplishments that made 2020 a year like no other for our company.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Thanks to the resilience, dedication, and resourcefulness of my colleagues all around the world, Johnson & Johnson didn’t just survive 2020—our company pivoted with great agility and delivered notable financial performance during a tumultuous year while continuing to invest in sustainable, transformative innovation for the long-term.”\n",
            "\n",
            "As we have during so many periods of upheaval since our founding in 1886, our broad base of diversified healthcare solutions created stability for investors as we increased the shareholder dividend for the 58th consecutive year.\n",
            "\n",
            "The core strengths that powered our performance last year are the same ones that have served our stakeholders well in every market environment: an unwavering focus on execution, innovation, and people.\n",

            "\n",
            "While the development of our COVID-19 vaccine in just 12 months is an incredible triumph of science, it was not our only significant achievement. Our Pharmaceutical business continued to outperform the industry across therapeutic areas and regions. And 2020 marked the 9th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational growth—all while keeping our pipeline submissions and approvals on track, as well as achieving greater patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. We received approval for a subcutaneous formulation of multiple myeloma drug DARZALEX® (daratumumab) in 2020—ahead of our scheduled U.S. PDUFA date. This new formulation took a multi-hour intravenous treatment down to a subcutaneous delivery that is executed in just minutes. We focused on educating healthcare practitioners and successfully launched the product in a virtual environment—reaffirming our strong commercial capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our Consumer Health business didn’t just meet but exceeded goals for the year, being agile enough to recognize and quickly adapt to fulfilling increased demand for products like TYLENOL® and LISTERINE® in millions of homes worldwide and recording approximately 55% year-over-year growth in e-commerce. Our Consumer Health team also refused to let the challenges of 2020 deter them from launching their ambitious Healthy Lives Mission. This holistic approach to health and wellness—advancing sustainable innovation and packaging, providing enhanced transparency to the ingredients used in our products, supporting proactive self-care, and encouraging new consumer behavior—has been a welcome reminder of what our company can accomplish when we tackle the widest range of unmet health needs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the most striking testament to the power of world-class execution can be seen in the rebound across our Medical Devices business after the COVID-19 pandemic caused many individuals to delay healthcare treatment—from routine exams to important elective surgeries to emergency room visits. Our Medical Devices business continued prioritizing patient and customer needs, maintaining product reliability, and advancing innovation. We quickly identified urgent needs and focused efforts on supporting patients by training more than 6 million healthcare professionals on our virtual platforms, conducting live and remote case support, securing and providing personal protective equipment (PPE), bringing together industry partners, and expanding coverage to emerging sites of care. Through these efforts we’ve developed new capabilities that strengthened our customer relationships and set us up for even greater performance in 2021 and beyond.\n",
            "\n",
            "We focus our sustainability efforts in areas where we believe we can make the greatest impact to advance health for humanity. As a healthcare company, Johnson & Johnson understands that climate health can affect human health. This is why we have a long-standing commitment to environmental health and set new climate goals in 2020 that we will track over the next 10 years. To this end, we are honored to have, once again, been recognized as a global corporate leader in climate action and water security and awarded two ‘A-List’ ratings from the Carbon Disclosure Project—the third year in a row for tackling climate change and the second year in a row for our work on water security.\n",

            "One thing that I think speaks volumes about both our performance and our prospects as a company was our 2020 investment in innovation. In the midst of all the year’s uncertainty, Johnson & Johnson invested an all-time high of $12.2 billion in research and development (up $800 million from 2019) and more than $7 billion in acquisitions, as we continued to fortify our pipeline and ensure we will be able to continue changing the trajectory of human health long after this pandemic is over. Among the year’s highlights in science and innovation:\n",
            "\n",
            "Vaccine development was just one area where our world-class scientists utilized their expertise for our Pharmaceutical business. We initiated the U.S. FDA filing for our BCMA CAR-T therapy ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients who have received three prior classes of therapies. We filed for approval of amivantamab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor Exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we filed for approval for UPTRAVI® (selexipag) injection for intravenous use to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and DARZALEX FASPRO™ for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with light chain for amyloidosis. We also hope to receive approval this year for ponesimod for multiple sclerosis, and PP6M for the treatment of schizophrenia. These developments will potentially change the lives of patients and their families in the years to come.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our Medical Devices business made strong progress achieving, and even accelerating, key pipeline milestones throughout the year. We continued to invest in innovation and advance critical programs across each franchise throughout 2020, including: further expansion of our Hip and Knee portfolios into high-growth market segments, enhancements to our industry-leading TECNIS™ family of intraocular lenses, the introduction of ECHELON ENDOPATH™ Staple Line Reinforcement, and the launch of CERENOVUS STROKE SOLUTIONS™. We remain incredibly excited about the great potential of the end-to-end digital surgery ecosystem and are simultaneously developing three differentiated robotic programs and recently achieved a significant milestone with the FDA clearance for our VELYS™ Robotic-Assisted Solution designed for use with the ATTUNE® Total Knee System. Our industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of these robotic and digital technologies—and it seems only fitting that the same company that helped pioneer sterile surgery 135 years ago is now poised to lead the way in bringing differentiated, cutting-edge new solutions to the 21st-century operating room.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Consumer Health, we displayed great agility in finding ways to ensure we could supply families worldwide with essential products throughout the pandemic. The innovation didn’t stop there: Our brands launched nearly 200 new products in 2020 and deepened our commitment to creating inclusive and sustainable health solutions that meet the needs of consumers. One timely example was the launch of NICORETTE® Quickmist SmartTrack in the United Kingdom. The world’s first digitally connected smoking cessation option, this tool was developed with top behavioral scientists to connect smokers to a support app and help them track against personalized programs.\n",

            "Because innovation doesn’t just happen in laboratories, I also want to recognize the impactful work of our Supply Chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner Research honored Johnson & Johnson with a number three ranking across all industries in its 2020 Supply Chain Top 25 Index, up five spots from our 2019 ranking, and the top ranking on its 2020 Healthcare Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

As we consider our post-pandemic future, we have the opportunity to decide what to bring with us into this new world, and what we should leave behind.

This is why Johnson & Johnson chose to focus on eliminating health inequities for people of color with our $100 million Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. The dramatically higher mortality rate for communities of color in the COVID-19 pandemic is just the most recent example of the disparity in access to quality healthcare and the resultant outcomes for patients and their families in these communities. Our determination is to put better health within the reach of everyone. This work includes the use of data to better understand the root causes of inequalities and to encourage information sharing and effective training methods for medical centers and clinics on a local level.

Health comes first in Medicare Advantage, where private plans are incentivized to address the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable populations by paying plans based on the health diagnoses and demographics of their members. The program enables us to focus on all contributors to health, including social determinant factors such as food insecurity and loneliness, leading to improved health outcomes and lower cost of care. As a result, Medicare Advantage plans address affordability for the member, with many plans offered to individuals for low or zero additional monthly premium while limiting maximum out-ofpocket expenses, and often including prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing coverage, among other supplemental benefits not covered by traditional Medicare. In addition, the consumer choice in Medicare Advantage creates a competitive environment in which innovation thrives, resulting in ongoing improvement to address the unique and holistic needs of the member. The significant value of the Medicare Advantage program has led seniors to increasingly choose Medicare Advantage over fee-for-service Medicare, with now more than 28 million1 Americans in the program, representing 45%1 of Medicare eligible individuals.\n",

We have a strong brand and our expertise caring for people as they age is highly recognized by consumers and notable organizations like Forrester, J.D. Power and USAA. As a result, we have increased individual Medicare Advantage market share over time, achieving annualized enrollment growth of 11% since 2017, which is well above market growth. Moreover, we have a proven track record of balancing membership and margin growth, with our long-term adjusted earnings growth target range of 11% to 15% continuing to be the ultimate goal. To that end, we have committed to drive a billion dollars of additional value for the enterprise through cost savings, productivity initiatives and value acceleration from previous investments. This will create capacity to fund growth and our investment in our Medicare Advantage business and allow further expansion of our Healthcare Services capabilities in 2023. These efforts span several areas, including performing a critical review of ongoing strategic initiatives across the company, intending to further focus investments on priorities where we have the greatest conviction of significant value potential, as well as driving greater operational efficiencies across the organization by modernizing, streamlining, and improving processes through automation and digital advancement. We are on a continuous journey of improvement and are confident in our ability to remain a leader in the Medicare Advantage industry, driving improved membership growth in 2023, while continuing to deliver on our long-term adjusted earnings growth target.\n",

Humana is in a unique position to address key health-related social need— like nutrition/food insecurity, social support and transportation through health plan benefits, and services that address both acute and long-term needs of individual members—as an important step towards health equity. We have made great progress over the last few years in addressing social determinants of health and health equity in a number of ways.

In addition, we announced our intent to build an additional 26 centers in 2022 under our existing joint venture with Welsh Carson. When combined with planned acquisitions, we expect this to increase our center count by approximately 20%, bringing our total center count to approximately 250 centers by the end of 2022.

As a result, Humana is now the largest home health and hospice organization in the nation. KAH has a strong fee-for-service home health business that we are committed to continuing to grow. With KAH’s complementary capabilities, we’ll be positioned better than ever to improve health outcomes of our members and to lower the total cost of care more broadly. KAH complements our existing Home Solutions business, enabling a continuum of care comprising preventive, primary, post-acute, urgent, and hospital-level care services. We’ve made substantial progress towards our goal of scaling and maturing a risk-bearing, value-based model that manages the provision of home health, durable medical equipment (DME) and home infusion services. We believe the model has significant value creation potential, both within Humana as well as payer agnostically. Our efforts to transform home health to a valuebased model come at a pivotal time for the industry. As seniors increasingly choose Medicare Advantage, there is a meaningful opportunity for home health organizations to engage differently with patients and Medicare Advantage payers to more holistically address patient needs and improve health outcomes, reduce the total cost of care for health plans, and share appropriately in this value creation.\n",

We’ve further developed quantitative and/or qualitative metrics within each pillar to track, monitor and measure our progress. Additionally, we expanded our ESG disclosures during 2021 to include frameworks established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Managed Care Standard and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) —reaffirming our commitment to transparency within external disclosures of our performance.

We expanded our manufacturing capability, ran multiple clinical studies and collaborated with many partners to bring the therapy to patients. Veklury became the first FDA-approved therapy for COVID-19 and by the end of 2020, it was being used to treat one in two hospitalized patients for COVID-19 in the United States.

There was no less emphasis on the many other diseases and conditions that exist throughout the world. Gilead and other companies continued to bring forward new medicines and we maintained the ongoing supply of existing therapies.

HCA Healthcare’s momentum continued to accelerate throughout this past year. We were able to accomplish this while staying true to our mission. We expanded our footprint in the communities we serve while also developing more comprehensive resources to support our caregivers and colleagues. We invested more in technology to improve our patients’ experiences, advance our clinical capabilities, and gain efficiencies. And finally, we discovered new ways to capitalize on our diverse footprint by partnering with leading companies to help accelerate these strategic initiatives.\n",

We saw growth in most major categories of our business, and we expect to see continued growth in 2022. With this expected growth, HCA Healthcare continues to confront two critical staffing needs — nurses and physicians — by growing our clinical education and comprehensive graduate medical education programs, in addition to initiatives discussed below. Similar to 2020, in 2021, we focused on caring for those suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic. From February 2020 to December 2021, our facilities cared for more than 271,000 COVID-19 inpatients, including more than 160,000 inpatients in 2021.\n",

For us, responding to this need starts with strengthening our recruitment and retention functions. For example, we have advanced our benefits and invested in creating an environment where nurses can treat their patients and, ultimately, discharge them in a more productive manner. Additionally, in June 2021, we created a $50 million “Investing in Our Colleagues” initiative to respond to feedback gathered through our Vital Voices program, an employee engagement survey conducted multiple times each year. Each facility used its portion of this initiative’s additional funds based on our nurses’ assessments of areas of greatest need to enhance patient care. We also continue to provide well-being support and resources through a partnership with PsychHub, a free COVID-19 mental health resource hub, and Nurse Care, a 24/7 free and confidential counseling program, to meet the needs of HCA Healthcare’s hospital-based nurses.\n",

In 2021, we announced the expansion of our nursing college in Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We have announced seven campuses since the acquisition in 2020. Furthermore, Galen College of Nursing has helped develop an innovative and evidence-based curriculum to prepare nurses for today’s workforce and meet the needs of patients.

As a result, HCA Healthcare has become a significant provider of clinical and medical education and is the largest sponsor of GME programs in the United States, with 299 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited programs, more than 4,800 residents and fellows, and 59 teaching hospitals across 16 states. By growing our GME program, we strive to build our pipeline of physicians for our facilities and meet the growing needs of our communities. We respect the autonomy and expertise of our physicians and advanced practice providers and collaborate with them through physician governance councils, operational and service line support, physician engagement and patient safety culture surveys, and our network of physician relationship specialists. We have also invested in more clinical resources for our physicians, building state-of-the-art operating rooms, upgrading facilities, and advancing technology capabilities, like telehealth, to increase access to care and further support and protect our physicians.

In its 2021 Hospital Safety Grades, The Leapfrog Group recognized 84% of HCA Healthcare hospitals with an A or B rating, as compared to 58% of hospitals nationally. In February 2021, 14 HCA Healthcare hospitals were recognized among the “250 Best Hospitals” by Healthgrades, which also recognized Mission Hospital, an HCA Healthcare affiliated hospital, as one of the “50 Best Hospitals.” In addition, 16 of the best performing hospitals in the nation are part of HCA Healthcare, according to Fortune/ IBM Watson Health’s 2021 “Top 100 Hospitals” Annual Study. This recognition testifies to the hard work of our nurses, physicians, and colleagues, and it’s because of their dedication to clinical excellence that HCA Healthcare continues to advance healthcare standards. We have also continued to share best practices to optimize our service lines across our facilities. As a result, in 2021, 18 HCA Healthcare facilities received Press Ganey Pinnacle of Excellence or Guardian of Excellence awards for patient experience.\n",

The COVID-19 Consortium of HCA Healthcare and Academia for Research GEneration (CHARGE) provides a framework for cooperation and coordination among all its members to pose research questions, scrutinize, and validate methods, and, most importantly, share and act on innovative ideas that will help lead to impactful results. The member institutions — including the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, Meharry Medical College, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and others — accessed the data in a research program directed by the HCA Healthcare Research Institute (HRI). As of December 31, 2021, 12 studies were being conducted or had been completed using de-identified data from more than 210,000 patients in the HCA Healthcare COVID-19 Registry.

In combination with significant investments in mobility to support clinical care, the partnership with Google Cloud is expected to empower physicians, nurses, and others with workflow tools, analysis, and alerts on their mobile devices to help clinicians respond quickly to changes in a patient’s condition.

            "In the spring of 2021, HCA Healthcare’s Information Technology Group (ITG) and Clinical Operations Group (COG) hosted a Coding for Caregivers “Hackathon” event that asked nurses to submit their ideas for improving work efficiencies at the patient bedside. HCA Healthcare nurses submitted more than 5,000 ideas which were reviewed by 29 teams comprised of nearly 600 participants — including clinical representatives, developers, project managers, and quality analysts — who provided solutions to improve care efficiencies for nurses across the organization. The collaboration produced a list of projects that are currently under development, including the introduction of an automated process for notifying clinicians when patient medications are refilled in their dispensing cabinets — saving valuable time and resources. An additional clinical area of focus is care transformation. In 2021, we established a new office of Care Transformation and Innovation (CT&I) dedicated to using HCA Healthcare’s capacity and scale to help care teams achieve better, more efficient, digitally-enabled outcomes through increased integration of technology into clinical care. This work is supported by a variety of experts across our clinical care, data science, and technology groups. Additionally, telehealth continues to be an essential point of access to healthcare for many of the communities we serve, and we are continuing to invest in our telehealth capabilities. For instance, in the past year, we’ve enabled multiple telehealth video and mobile applications to be used by 6,000 providers in our outpatient and hospital-based clinics and added more than 3,000 telehealth endpoints in our hospitals.\n",

Likewise, our more than 45,000 active and affi liated physicians across HCA Healthcare continually display courage and skill while caring for others. In addition to the patient care given in our healthcare facilities, HCA Healthcare teams serve their communities in many ways. In May 2021, the HCA Healthcare Foundation announced the Healthier Tomorrow Fund, a new $80 million community impact fund focused on addressing high-priority community needs and health equity. The fund provides grants to nonprofit organizations in 25 communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence.\n",

            "Just as important, HCA Healthcare continued to support our communities aff ected by natural disasters. When Hurricane Ida made landfall in August 2021 as a Category 4 hurricane, our teams ensured our Louisiana hospitals had appropriate staff , medications, supplies, food, water, and generator power while also safely coordinating patient transfers to sister hospitals and other nearby facilities. When a severe tornado system struck Kentucky, HCA Healthcare stepped up to provide care at TriStar Greenview Regional Hospital and contributed $250,000 in funding to support organizations providing relief services. When floods impacted Middle Tennessee, aff ecting many of our colleagues and neighbors, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation contributed $250,000 to support relief eff orts.

The eff ort supported HCA Healthcare’s inaugural Healthy Food for Healthier Tomorrows Food & Nutrition Drive, and included 77,830 meals donated by colleagues, 52,000 meals provided by colleague charitable donations, and 240,000 meals from $60,000 in grants provided by the HCA Healthcare Foundation. And while the opioid crisis continues to affect our communities, HCA Healthcare collected 15,566 pounds of unused and expired medications, exceeding last year’s record of 13,523 pounds, during our third annual “Crush the Crisis” opioid take-back events. A total of 96 HCA Healthcare facilities across 17 states held events that were aimed at educating communities on the dangers of opioid misuse and the importance of safe and proper disposal of expired and unused prescription medications. The events collectively disposed of an estimated 10.7 million doses of medication. As part of our continued commitment to providing equitable access to high-quality care for all patients, HCA Healthcare formed the Health Equity Council in January 2021 to help identify and address health disparities within and outside of our hospitals, as well as to develop strategies that advance health equity. This cross-functional group of senior leaders led by our chief medical officer and chief diversity officer analyzes race, ethnicity, and other data to address disparities and improve patient quality, safety, and satisfaction outcomes for diverse populations.\n",

We know our ability to serve diverse communities most eff ectively depends on a workforce that reflects those communities. In December 2021, HCA Healthcare donated $1.5 million to Florida A&M University’s School of Allied Health Sciences. This donation and future partnerships are intended to strengthen student pathways from undergraduate to graduate to management careers in healthcare, while also advancing diversity in healthcare and supporting the next generation of healthcare leaders. Our dedication to the communities we serve reflects our desire to address critical environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. For instance, one of the ways we are accelerating our eff orts and embracing our role in creating healthier tomorrows is through our environmental sustainability strategy. The strategy includes four main pillars: managing energy and water responsibly, enhancing our climate resilience, sourcing and consuming efficiently, and greening our capital programs. These pillars guide our work to build a balanced plan to support Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction and to ensure our environmental strategy is designed to complement our commitment to the care and improvement of human life, which extends to our environment. \n",

From their efforts, we were named a 2021 World’s Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere for the 11th year and were recognized on the 2021 LinkedIn Top Companies list. The positive impact HCA Healthcare’s caregivers and colleagues have on the communities we serve is profound, unmatched, and continues to grow. To that point, in 2021, we expanded our reach by opening and acquiring new facilities in Colorado, Florida, Tennessee, and Georgia. We also acquired a majority stake in Brookdale Health Care Services which is foundational to our ongoing efforts to provide quality home health and hospice care to our patients. We believe this joint venture will lead to improved care coordination across the HCA Healthcare network. Moving forward, we are confident that we are well-positioned with many diversified opportunities to allocate capital in a productive manner. We believe HCA Healthcare’s future is very bright.

            "To My Fellow Stakeholders, As we enter the 90th year of the history of our Company, we are energized by the extraordinary effort of Team Schein to help our customers and our business recover from the challenges of the past two years, pleased by the resulting financial achievements, and enthusiastic and optimistic for our future. Even as the global supply chain remained unsettled in 2021, Henry Schein delivered for our stakeholders. As vaccines and other infection control measures allowed society to begin resuming normal activities, we recorded net sales in 2021 of $12.4 billion, up 22.6% compared with 2020. GAAP diluted EPS for 2021 increased 58.4%, or an increase of 52.2%* on a non-GAAP basis, largely reflecting a rebound in patient traffic from the early days of the pandemic and elevated demand for our products and services, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-related products. We delivered full-year operating cash flow from continuing operations of $709.6 million versus $593.5 million in 2020, and we invested $570.6 million in acquisitions and $401.2 million in stock repurchases. Our strategy of supporting organic growth with acquisitions remained a key element of our success, with acquisitions representing 4.2% of 2021’s total revenue increase. In 2021, Henry Schein continued to increase our exposure to faster-growing and higher-margin products and services through organic growth and acquisitions. Our portfolio of complementary software and specialty products, as well as services offerings, represent an ever-increasing percentage of Henry Schein’s operating margin and total operating income, generating full-year revenue of $928.6 million, a 27.2% increase in local currencies. This offering includes what we refer to as Dental Specialty Products, which encompasses oral surgery, implant and bone regeneration products as well as endodontic and orthodontic products, plus our Technology & Value-Added Services, including Henry Schein One, a provider of integrated software and services to the dental profession. In 2021, growth was strong in each of our three Dental Specialty Product categories. Our BOLD+1 Strategy Positions Us for the Future  Our optimism for the future stems in large part from the many actions our Company took in 2021 to further position Henry Schein for growth and profitability. Two of these actions are especially meaningful – the development of our 2022–2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, a key goal of which is to expand our faster-growing, higher-margin software and specialty products, and services offerings, while investing for growth in our core distribution businesses, and the implementation of a new leadership structure for our distribution businesses to support the plan. In 2021, we established the North America Distribution Group and the International Distribution Group, representing an evolution of our “One Distribution” strategy to more tightly integrate the management of our Dental and Medical distribution businesses. The new structure is designed to better leverage functions, talent, processes, and systems across Henry Schein’s distribution businesses to enhance our customer experience and maximize efficiency and performance, thereby driving growth in sales and related operating income in absolute terms. Our operating model provides the basis for us to leverage a “One Schein” offering to customers, who increasingly rely upon Henry Schein’s comprehensive network of innovative solutions and services, along with our distribution capabilities, to provide an exceptional experience that helps make their practices more successful and improve patient outcomes. Together, we make the world healthier. In short, our 2022–2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan positions our Company to BUILD (“B”) complementary software, specialty, and services businesses for high growth; OPERATIONALIZE (“O”) One Distribution to deliver exceptional customer experience, increased efficiency, and growth; LEVERAGE (“L”) One Schein to broaden and deepen relationships with our customers; and DRIVE (“D”) digital transformation for our customers and for Henry Schein. +1 = Pursuing Profits and Purpose Our BOLD+1 strategy is driven by our long-standing belief in the intersection of profits and purpose. We carefully balance the goals of our five constituencies (the “+1”) – Team Schein, customers, suppliers, investors, and society – through Henry Schein’s management philosophy, the “Mosaic of Success.” By giving back to society in concert with our team, customers, and suppliers, we strive to generate greater value for our investors. In 2021, we once again took numerous steps toward fulfilling our commitment to the constituents we serve within the context of what is now known as the Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) movement. Here, in brief, is a summary of the work we pursued in 2021 to advance our ESG approach to business. Addressing climate change and ensuring a healthy environment are among our generation’s most difficult and important challenges, and within this eff ort Henry Schein can and will play a meaningful role where opportunity for impact exists. For example, we signed the Business Ambition for 1.5⁰C Initiative and joined the Race to Zero. We are also a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders and the National Academy of Medicine Action Collaborative on Decarbonization of the Health Care Sector. Through these initiatives, we are working to reduce the climate impact of our own operations and within the wider health care industry supply chain. The “Social” pillar of the ESG movement is where Henry Schein is actively advocating for the equitable distribution of health care services to underserved and underrepresented populations is a core tenet of our health equity work as well as emergency health care response. In 2021, we committed to donating at least $50 million in cash and product through Henry Schein Cares and the Henry Schein Cares Foundation, Inc. by 2025 to advance health equity. In the area of diversity and inclusion, we are focused on increasing the representation of women and other underrepresented groups in senior operating roles and promoting inclusivity training and education to elevate and support a diverse network of TSMs, fostering an environment where all TSMs can thrive individually and collectively. In 2021, we added to our existing roster of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) with the establishment of COLEGAS, for our Hispanic and Latin American TSMs, and announced the formation of ERGs for our Pan-Asian, Military Veteran, and Disabled communities. All of our ERGs are open to all TSMs. Additionally, Henry Schein has a long record of advancing diversity in the professions we serve, including our support of the American Dental Association’s Institute for Diversity in Leadership and the National Dental Association, among other organizations and initiatives. We also strengthened our investment this year in what we believe is our greatest competitive advantage—our Team Schein Members. In these challenging times, we increased our emphasis on mental wellness and stress management as part of a broader eff ort to recruit and retain the extraordinary individuals who comprise Team Schein. Underlying our ESG eff orts is a commitment to ethical corporate governance, which starts with our largely independent and diverse Board of Directors, including five Board Committees, and governed by our Nominating and Governance Committee. Through our Sustainability Committee, a cross-functional team of senior and middle management that reviews our progress regularly, we continue to steadily advance our sustainability work. As of this writing, the world is witnessing a rise in geopolitical instability of a magnitude not seen since 1945. As with prior humanitarian crises – in Haiti, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, and other parts of the world – Team Schein is committed to responding to the health care needs of the Ukrainian people and other refugees, working in partnership with philanthropic partners, customers, and suppliers. In moments such as these, we more fully appreciate the role we can play to help alleviate the suffering of those in need, and we have committed at least $1 million in cash and products in this regard.  Our ability to give back to society in times of crisis is a direct result of our business success, and that success reflects the extraordinary commitment, hard work, and dedication of Team Schein. For 90 years, this Company has been blessed with a team that rises to every challenge and pulls together to overcome any obstacle. I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Finally, to ensure public accountability for each of these activities, we committed to providing reporting in 2022 in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, along with issuing our initial Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures report in 2022. Boldly Creating Value for Our Stakeholders The 2022–2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan builds on our previous strategic plans by focusing on those markets and geographies where Henry Schein can make a real difference for the ultimate benefit of our customers and their patients. And in doing so, we will enable our customers to become more successful and improve patient outcomes while creating value for our stakeholders— that’s BOLD+1. We intend to advance the seamless, unified integration of our suite of products and service solutions while demonstrating a deep commitment to giving back to society. These activities are mutually reinforcing and benefit all of our stakeholders. The theme of this year’s annual report – Boldly Creating Value for Our Stakeholders – brings together all the individual elements of our new strategic plan. Gratitude for Our People and Performance I would like to take special note of the bittersweet retirements of Steve Paladino, Gerry Benjamin, and Barry Alperin. At the end of April 2022, our Chief Financial Officer, Steven Paladino, will retire after 35 years of dedicated service at Henry Schein, including 29 years as CFO. Steven joined Henry Schein in our finance department in 1987 when the business generated approximately $125 million in revenue, and our success since then reflects the considerable contributions made by Steven. We are pleased Steven will remain a member of our Board of Directors and an adviser to Henry Schein. Succeeding Steven is Ronald N. South, Henry Schein’s Vice President, Corporate Finance, since 2008 and Chief Accounting Officer since 2013, who will become the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Olga Timoshkina, who joined Henry Schein this past September as Vice President, Corporate Controller, will succeed Ron as Vice President, Corporate Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, while Graham Stanley was appointed as Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer on September 15, 2021. We implemented this succession plan to complement our talented group of corporate senior finance leaders and business unit CFOs. Additionally, Gerry Benjamin, our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer since 2000, is retiring on July 1, 2022, after 34 years with the Company. Gerry joined Henry Schein in 1988 and led the continuous transformation of our Global Services Group to meet the needs of each of our constituencies as we grew from being a private, domestic mail-order business into an international, full-service, publicly traded company with nearly 22,000 Team Schein Members and operations in 32 countries. His leadership was instrumental in maintaining the operational excellence for our customers over the years. We are pleased that Gerry will continue to be an adviser to Henry Schein following his retirement. Succeeding Gerry is Michael Ettinger, who has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Ettinger joined the Company in 1994 and has been Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs since 2013. Prior to his current position, Michael served as General Counsel for the Company. The Global Services leadership team reporting to Michael includes Lorelei McGlynn, Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, Jim Mullins, Senior Vice President, Global Supply Chain, Chris Pendergast, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, and Shirley Taylor, Vice President, Global Chief Security and Safety Officer. Barry Alperin will retire from our Board of Directors after 26 years of exceptional service, having joined our board in 1996, shortly after the Company’s initial public offering. Joining our Board in 2021 were Mohamad Ali, Deborah Derby, Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, and Scott Serota, who will undoubtedly provide valuable perspectives to the Company. We wish Steven, Gerry, and Barry the very best in their retirement and thank them for their many contributions to the Company. Along with the entire Henry Schein Board of Directors, I would like to express my utmost confidence in Henry Schein’s strategy, leadership, and Team Schein. I again off er my sincerest thanks to our Team Schein Members across the globe for their dedication, and also thank our customers, supplier partners, and investors for their continued trust. We intend to reward your faith in us.\n",

            "Throughout the second year of the pandemic, the Ecolab team continued to excel, providing critical expertise and innovative solutions to accelerate our growth and help protect the health of people, our planet and businesses everywhere. The last two years have underscored the importance of our value proposition and the effectiveness of our unique business model. We are very proud of our team and their commitment to excellence, and the positive impact we delivered for our customers and society. Thanks to the great work of the Ecolab team, we experienced strong growth in 2021. We did so despite continued COVID-related headwinds, significant supply chain constraints and an unexpected rapid rise in cost inflation. By maintaining strong focus on what we could control, our business fundamentals significantly improved. Net new business reached record levels, pricing accelerated quarter after quarter, our innovation efforts delivered a record pipeline and our long-term digital investments kept driving productivity while enhancing customer experience. All of these drivers helped us deliver a strong 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. EXPANDING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES There is no question that our strong momentum in 2021 is due primarily to our continued investments in our team in 2020. Through the worst of the pandemic’s early stages, we chose to maintain our investments in our most critical long-term business drivers — our people, our innovation, our digital capabilities and our future. We maintained our sales-and-service team, ensured their personal safety and protected their pay. We continued investments in critical growth areas, including R&D and digital solutions, and invested in new, innovative programs such as Ecolab Science Certified™. As the markets recovered, these investments enabled us to accelerate growth by enhancing customer relationships and driving share when most competitors were scaling back investments. Ecolab’s spirit of commitment, innovation and service shined when our customers needed it the most. In 2021, our R&D team generated another record innovation pipeline, with more than 50 major innovations designed to help customers protect their own customers from COVID infection risks and deliver better outcomes, at a lower total cost, while reducing their impact on natural resources and the environment. We also opened our new Ecolab Healthcare Advanced Design Center, a state-of-the-art innovation center to provide customers with end-to-end design and manufacture of custom sterile barriers for robotic and diagnostic surgical equipment. Further, our strategic acquisition of Purolite provides us with a new rapid-growth, high-margin business, which extends our capabilities in our already highly successful global Life Sciences business. At the same time, it will help us create another global growth platform, one comparable to what we’ve built with water and food safety. By uniquely combining environmental safety in pharmaceutical manufacturing with product safety and quality to produce life-saving drugs and vaccines, Purolite will enable us to offer a broader portfolio of critical solutions to meet the unique needs of our Life Sciences customers. Ecolab has a long history of growth and expanding our total available market opportunities, from $32 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2020 to $152 billion today. We’ve accomplished this by adding new solutions and service offerings, including those for life sciences, high-tech manufacturing, data centers and animal health. In addition, our customers’ increasing focus on improving sustainability continues to drive the need for our effective solutions to help them achieve their goals toward net-zero impact. DELIVERING MEASURABLE CUSTOMER VALUE The Ecolab team delivered for our customers throughout the year, providing unmatched expertise and industry-leading programs to help protect staff and customers from COVID, solve operational challenges and meet sustainability and net-zero goals. The Ecolab Science Certified Program, designed to advance cleaner, safer practices, continues to expand and has been adopted in thousands of restaurant, hotel, event and retail sites. We also continued to expand our digital offerings, enabling real-time intelligence and actionable insights to create more value for our customers. Through our proprietary eROISM approach, which calculates the exponential return on our customers’ investment in our products and services, we measure the positive impact of our solutions. eROI helps customers credibly quantify their return through water, energy and comprehensive operating cost savings while enabling them to plan and track their progress across a range of performance and environmental goals. Our ability to deliver major results for our customers then becomes a major driver of Ecolab’s profitable growth. ADVANCING OUR GLOBAL CAPABILITIES TO LEAD IN ESG In 2021, the Ecolab team delivered on its ESG goals by continuing to make meaningful progress in environmental, social and governance toward achieving our 2030 Impact Goals. We expanded our positive impact through our work with customers, accelerated efforts within our own operations and nurtured our talent. We advanced our efforts to achieve a positive water impact and halve our carbon emissions by 2030. Our U.S. facilities are now sourcing 100% renewable energy, and we’re on track to source 100% renewable energy globally by 2030. Internally, we made more progress toward our representation goals for women and people of color in 2021 than the previous four years combined. We are proud to say that last year, 38% of all new management-level hires globally were women and 35% of all new management-level hires in the U.S. were people of color. We also achieved a 96% increase in year-over-year spend with diverse suppliers. Ecolab’s commitment to ESG and operating ethically, responsibly and sustainably was again recognized by several leading organizations in 2021, including being named one of the world’s most ethical companies, one of the world’s most sustainable companies and a leading company for diversity and gender equality. For more information on our ESG progress, please see pages 10–11 of this report. In the same spirit, over the last 12 months, a few leadership changes were announced, all part of our long-term talent planning process. In December, Chief Financial Officer Dan Schmechel announced his plans to retire in 2022, and Scott Kirkland, previously senior vice president and corporate controller, was named CFO. We’d like to once again take the opportunity to thank Dan for his major contributions to our success during his 27-year career at Ecolab. WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE FUTURE The year again showed the importance of our work and the way we do it for the benefit of people, the planet and businesses. Our expertise, solutions and positive impact are critical to our customers and society, and we are well-positioned to drive strong sales and earnings growth by helping meet the world’s growing climate and public health challenges. By 2030, the global population is projected to reach 8.5 billion people. With this increase will come a heightened risk of infection and broader healthcare needs, additional challenges to ensure a safe food supply chain and an increasing strain on the world’s limited freshwater resources. With our innovative programs like Ecolab Science Certified and game-changing technology such as those offered by Purolite, we believe no company is better positioned to help protect people than Ecolab. Our world’s climate is changing rapidly, and as businesses increasingly set aggressive sustainability goals, there’s no company better positioned than us to help our partners drive competitive advantage while helping to protect our planet. We have a lot to be proud of in 2021, and we thank our 47,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to each other, our customers and our company. We enter 2022 with strong business momentum and a greater purpose to make the world cleaner, safer and healthier by protecting people and the resources vital to life. We will continue to grow our business by helping our customers, our communities and each other thrive, with strong entrepreneurial spirit, ingenuity, agility and heart.\n",

            "Powered by our purpose – to create medicines that make life better – Lilly responded with urgency, resilience and the full force of our scientific expertise to combat the pandemic and its devastating effects on our most vulnerable communities and health systems around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "With patients at the center of everything we do, we found new ways to collaborate across industry, governments and research institutions to discover and deliver new COVID-19 treatments in record time. We moved quickly to protect the well-being of our workforce, initiate local testing support, and maintain a steady supply of medicines for about 45 million people who rely on us.\n",
            "\n",
            "And despite the year’s many challenges, our scientists made steady pipeline progress across our core therapeutic areas, advancing discoveries with the potential to transform diabetes care, slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, relieve chronic pain without addictive drugs, advance immunology and turn hard-to-treat cancers from fatal to manageable. As a pioneer in the development of life-changing medicines for almost 150 years, we look forward to bringing greater hope and better health to more people around the world.\n",

            "Investing in Breakthroughs\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2020, Lilly invested 25% of our revenue in R&D, more than nearly every other company in our industry. To help patients with COVID-19, we studied and received Emergency Use Authorization for three therapies: baricitinib, bamlanivimab, and the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Additional highlights include:\n",
            "\n",
            "Donanemab, an investigational medicine for Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrated significant slowing in patients’ clinical decline in a Phase 2 study.\n",
            "\n",
            "Studies of LOXO-305 in oncology, tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes and Verzenio in early breast cancer generated promising data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trulicity was approved for additional doses and cardiovascular event reduction, and Jardiance was submitted for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction.\n",
            "\n",
            "Retevmo launched for non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancers, and Lyumjev rapid-acting insulin launched for diabetes.\n",
            "\n",
            "New indications and line extensions were approved for Taltz, Cyramza and Olumiant.\n",
            "\n",
            "This progress adds to a sustained period of R&D productivity that has seen Lilly launch 16 medicines since 2014. We’ll continue to replenish our pipeline, as 17 new candidates entered clinical testing, surpassing 2019’s total of 16, the highest in a decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "We invested more than $8 billion in 2020 to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after-tax investment in R&D. We added more collaborations, acquiring Prevail Therapeutics to establish a gene therapy program, working with Dicerna to produce the first siRNA asset to enter our clinic, and making a $100 million commitment to the pharma-led $1 billion AMR Action Fund – all of which hold great promise for scientific innovation and global health.\n",
            "\n",
            "Making a Sustainable Impact\n",
            "\n",
            "While delivering life-changing medicines is essential, it’s just the first step. To make sure our breakthroughs help more people, Lilly works to improve access and equity throughout the global health-care system. We’re collaborating with the Gates Foundation to supply our COVID-19 treatment to lower-income countries. In the U.S., partnerships with the nonprofit and public sectors have helped millions of people gain access to other Lilly medicines. We’ve donated more than 7 million insulin doses and pens over the past five years, and most monthly Lilly insulins are now available to patients for $35 or less per month, with or without insurance. We are particularly excited about our collaboration with Life for a Child that will expand access to care for approximately 150,000 youth with diabetes across 65 countries.\n",
            "\n",
            "To fulfill our purpose, we need the best people to solve the world’s toughest health challenges. We work every day to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture, where everyone is valued and heard. We have made measurable diversity progress across our workforce, management, corporate leadership and board of directors. We’re taking action to improve equity more broadly as well, launching a Racial Justice Initiative to further the work we’re doing both within Lilly and in our communities. We’re expanding diversity in our clinical trials, increasing employment opportunities, and investing in new health-care initiatives for marginalized communities. And we announced a $30 million investment in the Unseen Capital Health Fund to support founders and innovators who are enhancing health access in historically marginalized communities across the U.S.\n",
            "\n",
            "These actions reflect Lilly’s focus on making meaningful contributions to our world and our deep commitment to our stakeholders. Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy flows directly from our purpose and our core values of integrity, excellence and respect for people. In 2021, we’re launching a new ESG site to provide a comprehensive picture of our sustainability strategy and progress, including new environmental goals for climate, waste and water.\n",

            "Driving Performance with Purpose\n",
            "\n",
            "In a difficult year, Lilly demonstrated operational resilience and achieved solid financial results. Worldwide revenue increased 10% to $24.5 billion in 2020. Partially offset by lower realized prices, the overall increase was driven by 15% volume expansion in important growth products, including our COVID-19 therapy bamlanivimab and our newest medicines, including Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, Taltz, Olumiant and Emgality, which continue to comprise a rising proportion of our revenues.\n",
            "\n",
            "We also continued our productivity journey, delivering nearly 300 basis points of operating margin expansion for our base business. We returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, and we announced a 15% dividend increase for the third straight year, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2021, despite pandemic headwinds affecting near-term demand, we expect revenue growth driven by volume, further operating margin expansion, and continued investment in our pipeline opportunities to sustain our long-term growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "With potential approvals of Verzenio in early breast cancer and Jardiance in heart failure, we’re also anticipating readouts for several late-phase assets, including tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. We have an extensive roster in early phase development, with proof-of-concept readouts for key molecules expected across our portfolio.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our work during the pandemic demonstrated that we can accelerate our use of digital technologies and advanced analytics to speed medicines to patients. We are committed to investing in new ways of making medicines, using RNA and gene technology. And we’ll be implementing new ways of working, employing digital capabilities to accelerate collaboration with partners, decentralize clinical trials, engage with and support customers, and increase the efficiency of business development in a virtual environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "With a renewed appreciation for what we can accomplish for patients, we are excited about the decade ahead for Lilly. We’re grateful for the support of all our stakeholders, the contributions of Lilly teammates, and our partners across the health-care system. We will continue to do all we can to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders by delivering medicines that make life better for people around the world.\n",

            "Dear Stakeholders: For DaVita, this past year fixed a spotlight on our teammates’ commitment to care for patients with kidney disease. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic created challenges that we could never have imagined at the beginning of 2020. These challenges – clinical, operational and financial – led to opportunities for us to harness the strength of our teams and our platforms to support our patients and our community in this time of global crisis. When I reflect on the year, I am inspired by the resilience, creativity and innovation showed by our organization to adapt to the unprecedented and rapidly changing landscape and by the depth of the empathy and commitment of our teams to each other and to the health and safety of our patients. COVID-19 Response Over the past year, we took significant steps to enhance our infection control and safety practices and create new processes such as the early cohorting of patients with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, to ensure that we could continue to provide high-quality care for more than 240,000 patients who depend on receiving life-sustaining dialysis treatment multiple times each week. Earlier this year, the dialysis community came together with the CDC and federal government to launch a national program to allocate COVID-19 vaccines directly to dialysis providers for the vaccination of end-stage renal disease patients and their front-line caregivers, an important policy by the administration to protect some of the nation’s most vulnerable patients. We continue to work hard to implement this program to help ensure that all of our patients who want to be vaccinated can receive a vaccine as soon as possible. Across the U.S., COVID vaccination rates for Blacks and Hispanics remain well below that of Whites and Asians. We have been able to deploy our care teams, including social workers and dietitians, to engage in one-on-one conversations to address common causes of vaccine hesitancy, with support from our Medical Directors. We believe these efforts, combined with offering patients direct access to the vaccine from a trusted care team and in a convenient site of care, have addressed the challenges with third-party sites, reduced hesitancy rates and improved health equity. At DaVita we have a long history of investing in the development and well-being of our teammates. Through the pandemic, we increased this investment in caring for our own teammates, including providing tens of millions of dollars in relief payments to eligible teammates, adjusting pay and paid time off practices to better support our teammates and enhancing benefits, including backup child care and free counseling and mental health resources. Clinical Outcomes and Care Initiatives In 2020, DaVita once again improved key clinical outcomes in our U.S. dialysis business, including our recognition as an industry leader for the eighth consecutive year in CMS’ Quality Incentive Program and for the last seven years under the CMS Five-Star Quality Rating system. Financial In 2020, operating income was $1.695 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.746 billion. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures please see page 73 of the accompanying Annual Report on Form 10-K. Consolidated operating cash flow was $1.979 billion in 2020. We invested $457 million in acquisitions and development in our businesses and $1.447 billion on repurchases of more than 16 million shares of our common stock in 2020, reducing our shares outstanding by more than 12 percent since the beginning of the year. Corporate Citizenship & Sustainability Being a responsible corporate citizen has long been an important principle at DaVita. Since 2008, we have published an annual social responsibility report we call Community Care, highlighting our organization’s and teammates’ contributions and support of the communities in which we live and operate. A shining example of supporting our communities was the decision by our Board and management to return $250 million of CARES Act funding so that government support and funding could be used by those organizations in greater need than us. In 2019 and 2020, our company surveyed key stakeholders to learn more about what Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) issues matter most to them and also reviewed the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) recommended metrics for health care service providers. Based on these data sources, we have identified our top ESG priorities and five key focus areas: • Patient Care • Teammate Engagement • Environmental Stewardship • Healthy Communities • Leading with Integrity and Accountability This month, we plan to publish a set of aspirational goals for 2025 across each of these five pillars of our ESG program, goals representing our ongoing commitment to advancing ESG-related initiatives. Furthermore, we recognize that the latest climate science sends a warning that we must dramatically curb temperature rise to avoid the impacts of climate change, and as a company, we want to do our part. Accordingly, we have presented our environmental goals for 2025 and beyond to the Science Based Targets initiative for their review and confirmation that our goals are in alignment with climate science. In 2021, for the first time we are publishing our ESG report based on the recommendations from SASB and its material topics for health care service providers. We also published our first report on Diversity and Belonging, disclosing our company’s diversity metrics and a roadmap for delivering our vision of cultivating a diverse organization where everyone belongs. We are tremendously proud of our efforts in sustainability and social responsibility. To learn more, I encourage you to read our 2020 Community Care social responsibility report at www.davita.com/communitycare. Conclusion While caring for our patients and teammates, we have continued to focus on stewarding resources responsibly to deliver financial results for our stockholders. Last year at this time, I shared with you how inspiring our 67,000 teammates around the world are, especially our caregiving teammates and physician partners. A year later, I feel even more strongly that our caregivers on the front line of this pandemic are heroes in every sense of the word. I thank them for their selfless service. Their courage, compassion and dedication honor the memory of those we have lost to the pandemic. Respectfully Submitted,\n",

With the strength of Evernorth’s pharmacy capabilities, we will lead this much-needed transition and capture a large portion of those savings for the benefit of our clients and customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second trend focuses on the growing recognition, which accelerated during the pandemic, of the link between mental and physical health. As the demand for behavioral health services continues to rise, we’ve focused on improving the access to and availability of care while also addressing affordability. Our Evernorth behavioral network grew again in 2021, doubling in size over the past five years. New digital provider relationships we established last year are improving access, availability and choice for our customers experiencing eating disorders, depression, anxiety and burnout. We also established a partnership with Ginger to provide our customers with on-demand behavioral health coaching, therapy and psychiatry services accessible via a mobile app. We were the first carrier to bring Ginger’s coaching services innetwork – because we know that early access to this support can prevent the onset of moreserious mental health conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The third trend focuses on rapidly changing access-to-care models, including the rise of virtual care and other alternative care delivery options driven by technological advancements and consumer preferences. Our 2021 acquisition of virtual telehealth leader MDLIVE within our Evernorth business is one example of how we’re leading the way in responding to the dramatic increase in new models for accessing care. We also see virtual care as a game-changing accelerant to improving affordability. Through MDLIVE, we’ve expanded access to virtual care services for millions of customers, with capabilities that now include primary and dermatology care, as well as behavioral health care, and we plan to continue introducing additional services. We’ve launched an innovative virtual-first health plan option for employers, another step forward in providing convenient and comprehensive care experiences for our customers. We’re also developing additional digital-first pathways to care for patients with conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders and anxiety and depression. These innovations bring services to our customers in a personalized, coordinated and affordable manner.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the health care landscape continues to change, we’re confident that we have the capabilities, partnerships and expertise that will allow us not only to respond, but to lead in shaping the future.\n",

            "2020 was a year that will undoubtedly be etched into our collective memory. The COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives and businesses, suddenly and substantially. We had to invent new ways to support each other and serve our customers, while safeguarding our associates’ health and safety. Fortunately, adaptability is deeply ingrained in our culture at Danaher and as I look back on , I am most struck by our associates’ resilience and dedication. Since the onset of the pandemic, our team has met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to help our customers and the global community. Powered by the Danaher Business System (DBS) and unified by our Shared Purpose, Helping Realize Life’s Potential, we have worked hard to navigate these unprecedented times from a position of strength.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is not lost on us that our financial performance in 2020 was, in part, driven by our work to tackle a health crisis that has had a devastating impact on so many around the world. That said, we are proud of our ability to continue supporting customers across all our businesses and the global community in the fight against COVID-19. While 2020 was certainly a challenging year for our teams and businesses, it was also a pivotal year for Danaher in our pursuit to become a better, stronger company. We closed the largest acquisition in our history—General Electric’s Biopharma business, now known as Cytiva—which reinforces our leading position in bioprocessing. Our strong financial performance enabled us to accelerate growth initiatives across our businesses, which we believe contributed to share gains in many of our end-markets. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, we made significant progress toward our sustainability goals in 2020. Through all these efforts, we solidified our position as a global science and technology leader, and we are heading into 2021 as a stronger company with an even brighter future. I am pleased to share some of our more significant achievements in 2020. A Critical Role in the Fight Against COVID-19 We are proud to support frontline healthcare providers with much-needed diagnostic testing capabilities, and to support the scientific community’s accelerated pursuit of new vaccines and treatments for the virus. IDT was an early leader in the diagnostic testing effort with their primer and probe kits, which provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 and a rapid 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV from a single patient sample. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics launched several new COVIDrelated antibody tests and an automated antigen test to help make higher-volume mass testing possible. As of March 1, 2021, our operating companies have collectively enabled or produced approximately 100 million COVID-19-related diagnostic tests. Cytiva and Pall Biotech have contributed significantly to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments around the world, helping to accelerate manufacturing on a massive scale under intense time pressure. As of March 1, 2021, we are involved in most vaccine and therapeutic projects underway globally, including all vaccines in the U.S. that have received FDA Emergency Use Authorization or are in late-stage clinical trials. Our teams’ efforts will continue to directly impact the lives of billions of people around the world, as there is still much more work to be done to tackle this global health crisis. A Transformational Acquisition Our acquisition of Cytiva is one of several, strategic portfolio moves we have made during the last few years that accelerated our evolution into a higher-growth, innovation-driven company. With the addition of Cytiva, we doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end-market, which now represents more than 50% of our Life Sciences platform’s annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we are better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-improving drugs faster and at a lower cost—an endeavor made even more urgent by today’s global health crisis. The caliber of talent at Cytiva is the business’ greatest asset. This highly innovative, passionate team has been working to solve its customers’ toughest biologics development and production challenges for over thirty years. In 2020, Cytiva achieved more than 25% core revenue growth and over $4 billion in revenue. We could not be more pleased with Cytiva's early results and are excited about what we can achieve together over the next thirty years and beyond. Investing for Growth Our strong margin performance and cash flow generation in 2020 enabled us to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments across Danaher. We expanded production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall to support increasing demand for COVID-related testing and treatments, while paving the way for sustainable long-term growth. Ongoing organic investments in research and development came to fruition in 2020 with several breakthrough product launches across our portfolio. SCIEX’s new 7500 System is the most sensitive Triple Quad mass spectrometer on the market, helping scientists detect and quantify analytes at previously undetectable levels. The Videojet 1280 Continuous Inkjet printer was designed with simplicity and reliability in mind, providing customers with a high-quality printer that is easy to use and minimizes disruptive downtime. And Leica Biosystems’ next-generation digital pathology scanner, the Aperio GT 450 DX, enables pathologists to evaluate tissue samples remotely without compromising quality or consistency—a crucial capability during the pandemic. Inorganic investments are also a key component of our growth strategy. Aquatic Informatics—a leading water-focused software provider—joined our Water Quality platform in 2020, bringing data analytics solutions to improve customer workflow and cost efficiencies. Since 2019, we have acquired ten businesses across all three of our segments, adding complementary products and technologies to help us solve our customers’ toughest challenges. Through both organic and inorganic growth investments, we continue to differentiate our offering and reinforce our market leadership, while enhancing our growth and earnings trajectory. Committed to Sustainability Our pursuit of continuous improvement has always been at the heart of everything we do. We strive to be better every day, and the many challenges we faced in 2020 highlighted our overarching responsibility and opportunity to do just that across our three pillars of sustainability: The innovation that fuels advancements across scientific disciplines, the people at the heart of our teams and communities, and the environment that sustains us. I have already shared how our teams have innovated to address some of the most pressing health and safety challenges of our time. I am incredibly proud of our fast and enterprising response to the COVID-19 crisis. Last year also highlighted the need for leadership and action, particularly around our efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive culture. In 2020 we established two key diversity goals: to increase our representation of women associates globally to 40%, and People of Color among U.S. associates to 35% by 2025. Our intention is to better reflect the communities in which we live, work, and serve our customers; and we believe that setting explicit goals provides the transparency and accountability necessary to drive meaningful change. Across Danaher, we have long considered the environmental impact of our products and operations—and we continually seek to improve on this front. In 2020, we established five-year reduction goals around our energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. To help operationalize these improvements, we have enhanced our DBS toolkit with energy management and waste reduction resources. These are just a few examples of how our deep commitment to continuous improvement inspires actions that benefit the greater good, and we will continue to prioritize measurable progress across the many facets of sustainability. A Future Full of Potential Reflecting on my first few months as CEO, my appreciation for our exceptional team and portfolio has deepened as I have had more opportunities to engage with our businesses and leaders. I am inspired by the considerable innovation happening across the organization, by the caliber and depth of our talent, and by our associates’ passion for their work and commitment to continuous improvement. It is clear the Danaher Business System is what drives us every day—it’s our ultimate competitive advantage—and I see it alive and well across the company. The powerful combination of these factors certainly contributed to making 2020 an exceptional and transformative year for Danaher. I am deeply honored and humbled that the Danaher Board of Directors asked me to lead our team into the future. I am also incredibly grateful for Tom Joyce’s mentorship and friendship over the past decade of working together. His strategic vision and leadership as CEO created tremendous value for Danaher and our shareholders, and an incredible foundation for our next chapter. Across Danaher we will strive to keep building an even better, stronger company and to positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways. We see tremendous opportunities to do just that in 2021 and beyond, and I am excited about what lies ahead for Danaher.\n",

            "Dear Stakeholder, It has been another year of dynamic, challenging conditions due to the pandemic. We have all faced enormous obstacles — professionally and personally — some continuing, some just emerging. As I reflect on my first year as CEO of Clorox, I’m very proud of how we delivered, pragmatic about the near-term challenges ahead and resolute about what we can accomplish over the long term as we continue to execute on our IGNITE strategy. Inspired by our purpose — to champion people to be well and thrive every single day — we remained true to three operating principles as we navigated the past year: • Embracing our role as a health and wellness company, which helped us prioritize our actions, including ensuring the safety of our people and supporting healthcare workers. • Putting people at the center, taking care of our teammates around the world and focusing on serving public health and consumer needs. • Leading with our values, with our commitment to doing the right thing guiding our strategic choices and actions. These principles, coupled with our IGNITE strategy, have served us well and are shaping the Clorox of tomorrow while having a meaningful impact on society today. Reflecting on Another Dynamic Year For the year, we delivered strong sales growth of 9%, with growth across all our business segments. On a two-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. This performance demonstrates Clorox’s unique strengths — the caliber of our people, equity of our brands and our ability to execute in extraordinary circumstances. We worked tirelessly over the past year to supply consumers with products across our portfolio, which was greatly impacted by the pandemic and people spending more time at home. This included cleaning and disinfecting products; vitamins, minerals and supplements; bags and wraps; and water filtration, food, grilling and cat litter products. As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position among global consumers, with high household penetration in Consumers have never seen greater value in our brands, which is reflected in the choices they’re making at shelf and online. the U.S. supported by strong repeat purchase rates and strong growth globally. Consumers have never seen greater value in our brands, which is reflected in the choices they’re making at shelf and online. We’ll continue to earn their long-term loyalty by investing in our brands through innovation that delivers superior user experiences. At the same time, the pandemic continues to cause tremendous volatility, and we are operating in an historically difficult cost environment. Rising input and transportation costs continue to pressure our profitability, which contributed to lower gross margin for the full year and a 2% decline in our fiscal year 2021 adjusted EPS.1 We expect these conditions to continue in fiscal year 2022 and are taking decisive action to mitigate headwinds while advancing our IGNITE strategy for long-term growth. Accelerating Our IGNITE Strategy The pandemic has highlighted the need to accelerate our strategy to take advantage of the strong consumer loyalty we have built, respond nimbly to changes in consumer behaviors and preferences, and set the company up for long-term success. I have a high degree of conviction that the focused actions we are taking will not only enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales growth target but also deepen our competitive advantages for years to come. These actions include: • Enhancing productivity: With fueling growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures and ensure the long-term health of our brands, we’ll continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program and productivity initiatives. • Investing in innovation: Innovation is at the heart of our IGNITE strategy, and we’re focused on innovation that is faster to market and delivers multiyear value. We doubled our innovation investments in fiscal 2021, and new products were a bigger contributor to our topline. We are also extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. • Leveraging purpose and personalization to drive loyalty: We have made great headway on our 2025 personalization goal to know 100 million people — crossing the halfway mark this fiscal year. Our higher investment in personalization has led to stronger relationships with consumers, which significantly improved ROI, driving confidence in our approach. Enhancing our digital capabilities: As consumers have increased their adoption of digital channels as a result of the pandemic, we are investing to further improve our digital capabilities and support our e-commerce, innovation and marketing initiatives. We have made great strides to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective, including nearly doubling our e-commerce business over the last two years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. • Driving growth runways: We expanded our global cleaning and disinfecting business and professional products portfolio to accelerate growth. Advancing Our ESG Goals We are rallying every person and every brand to contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive world. Harnessing resources internally by integrating environmental, social and governance commitments into our businesses is critical to achieving our ambitious goals, while collaborating externally with others is crucial to tackling the challenges we face collectively. Some of the highlights of our progress on environmental initiatives in fiscal year 2021 include achieving 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and Canada and increasing the number of plants that have achieved zero-waste-to-landfill status, now at 56% and tracking toward our 2025 goal of 100%. We also received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative of our 2030 science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and have announced our commitment to reach net zero emissions across our operations and our value chain (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. On the people side of ESG, I’m particularly proud that, in a trying year, we achieved our best safety score in modern history with a recordable incident rate of 0.26, which is significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. We also continued to work toward a more inclusive, diverse and equitable workplace. Pay equity is a part of that. As we’ve done in past years, we reviewed every nonproduction teammate’s pay for potential discrepancies. We adjusted where needed and will continue this review annually. This year, I also renewed our pledge to the CEO Action for Diversity, reflecting my personal commitment to advancing inclusion and diversity. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we reaffirm our commitment to its Ten Principles by driving a strategy that prioritizes these and other ESG goals. Focusing on Health Security in Our Communities We continue to pay it forward by giving back. In 2021 we made $9 million in grants to charitable organizations and $8 million in product donations, plus $2.7 million in cause marketing, for a total community contribution of nearly $20 million. This included a second round of COVID relief funding, ongoing support of racial justice initiatives and community building. The Clorox Company Foundation this year adapted its mission to be aligned with the company purpose. This led to a new signature theme, health security, which will guide our foundation’s efforts to bring about equal opportunities for underresourced people and communities. Confidence in Our Future Led by our values of doing the right thing, putting people at the center and playing to win, we are building a stronger, more resilient company. We have a portfolio of leading brands that have never been more loved by consumers and a clear plan to meet our long-term growth targets. Our strategy and the perseverance of our team around the world throughout the pandemic gives me great confidence in our ability to win and accelerate growth in the future, creating value for all of Clorox’s stakeholders. I am excited about the future and want to thank all of our teammates, customers, consumers, investors and partners for your support of our company. \n",

            "My fellow stockholders, 2020 was a year like no other. The COVID-19 pandemic stole millions of lives while throwing many others into economic hardship. Disasters escalated the urgency of our global climate crisis. And events throughout the year intensified the need for action in addressing persistent racial injustice within our communities. The impact of all of these will be with us for a long time. At Biogen, these unprecedented challenges have strengthened our purpose to address science for the betterment of humanity. We found the resilience to deliver a strong operating performance and maintain global leadership across our core businesses. My dedicated colleagues, rather than being overcome by hardship and everyday challenges, continued to advance our pipeline and our strategy to build a multifranchise portfolio leveraging the interconnectivity within neuroscience. In 2020, we continued to carry out our Biogen FORWARD strategy that we have been building upon for the past four years. This strategy aims to leverage science and research to execute on our core business today while also developing and expanding our neuroscience portfolio to deliver for tomorrow. In doing so, we give hope to millions of patients as well as their loved ones and their caregivers, while positioning the company for what we believe will be a transformative 2021. We now have 10 programs either in Phase 3 or filed with regulatory agencies, including in Alzheimer’s disease, neuropsychiatry, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ophthalmology. In 2020, we added or advanced 12 clinical programs, bolstering our early- and late-stage pipelines through both internal development and collaborations with leading neuroscience companies, including Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Sangamo), Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Denali) and Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (Sage). We believe we are well positioned for future growth with readouts expected in 2021 from eight clinical programs, of which four are pivotal readouts. CEO LETTER One of the most promising and near-term of these investigational therapies is aducanumab, which we are developing in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). We completed regulatory filings of aducanumab in multiple geographies during 2020, and we remain ready to launch should our application be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, aducanumab would be the first therapy to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer’s disease. We are focused on advancing our broader purpose as an organization, as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity. We strive to be leaders by taking meaningful action for the patients we serve, our employees, the environment and the community – including accelerating our efforts in diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe that taken together, all of these steps contribute to sustainable, long-term stockholder value. Financial Performance I am proud of the more than 9,000 members of the Biogen team for their dedicated focus on day-to-day execution in order to serve all of our stakeholders. Despite the uncertainties and hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for our society and our industry, full-year GAAP diluted earnings per share were $24.80 and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $33.70. We generated $13.4 billion in revenue, representing a 6% decrease versus the prior year. This decline was largely due to an erosion in U.S. TECFIDERA revenue. We achieved multiple sclerosis (MS) product revenue in the U.S. of $2.86 billion through June 30, 2020, the period before multiple, deeply discounted TECFIDERA generics entered the U.S. market. During the second half of 2020, MS product revenue in the U.S. was $2.25 billion. During 2020, Biogen generated approximately $4.2 billion in net cash flow from operations and $3.8 billion in free cash flow. This cash flow generation continued to provide us with significant flexibility to allocate capital with the goal to maximize returns for our stockholders. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we also returned approximately $6.7 billion to stockholders through share repurchases during the year. We executed eight business development deals for a total value of approximately $3 billion in 2020 and ended the year with $3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We will continue to allocate capital efficiently, effectively and appropriately. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure as well as aim for superior returns from the investments we make. Delivering on Our Core Business Very few therapeutic areas have as much need or hold as much promise for medical breakthroughs as neuroscience. Our work over the years has centered on pursuing therapies that meaningfully slow or halt the progression of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. That focus has resulted in our leadership in MS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). While new entrants in these areas have pressured our market position, we have repeatedly demonstrated resilience with strong execution and a commitment to advancing treatment options for patients. In addition, a key part of our Biogen FORWARD strategy is to unlock the potential of our biosimilars business. We believe biosimilars can lower healthcare system costs broadly, creating headroom for innovation. They can enable governments to potentially redirect savings to priorities such as increasing access to transformative therapies. Multiple Sclerosis Globally, 2.8 million people suffer from MS. It is a progressive disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, resulting in physical disability as well as neurological dysfunctions involving movement, vision and cognition. For nearly 25 years, we have led in the research and development of new therapies to treat this disease, and we remain focused on developing next-generation treatments. Our portfolio of 5 MS disease-modifying therapies has helped improve the lives of more than 1 million patients worldwide, and we have more than 25 active clinical trials. Our entire MS portfolio, including royalties from OCREVUS®, generated $8.7 billion in global revenue in 2020. We demonstrated our resilience through our continued dedication to providing efficacious therapies for patients and our strong execution, despite the entry of TECFIDERA generics that impacted our revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2020. A critical part of our strategy as leaders in MS is, and will continue to be, investment in innovation to address continuing unmet need. In the first half of 2020, we filed for regulatory review of a subcutaneous formulation of TYSABRI in both the U.S. and the European Union (EU). This subcutaneous formulation was approved in the EU in March 2021 and offers a competitive, more convenient administration profile in the space for high-efficacy MS treatments. We also received approval in the U.S. and the EU for a new intramuscular administration for PLEGRIDY. In addition, we continued to advance the potential use of extended interval dosing of TYSABRI. We presented new data demonstrating the reduced risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare brain infection, through the use of extended interval dosing compared to the currently approved dosing. Biogen continued its U.S. launch of VUMERITY. By year end, despite challenges to bringing a new treatment to market during the pandemic, VUMERITY was the number two MS product and the number one MS oral in new prescriptions in the U.S. Spinal Muscular Atrophy SMA is a leading genetic cause of mortality in infants, affecting about 1 in every 11,000 babies born in the U.S. SMA has a devastating effect on voluntary muscle movement, leading inevitably to muscle atrophy. Tragically, without treatment, most infants with the most severe type of SMA die within two years. Children with other types of the disease experience lasting mobility and quality of life issues throughout their teen and adult lives. SPINRAZA (nusinersen) generated full-year global revenues of $2.1 billion in 2020. Outside of the U.S., full-year revenue increased 9% versus the prior year with continued growth in sales volumes. Biogen ended 2020 with roughly 11,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including through our clinical studies and expanded access program. In the face of increasing competition in the SMA market, we believe that the proven efficacy and well-established safety profile of SPINRAZA makes it a foundation of care for patients. We continued to generate additional data in 2020, including from NURTURE, which is the longest-running study in the industry examining pre-symptomatic patients with SMA. The data showed that patients being treated with SPINRAZA continued to maintain and make progressive gains in motor function compared to the natural course of the disease. We continue to advance research in the fi eld, exploring how SPINRAZA could create better outcomes for patients that still have unmet need – including after being treated with other therapies on the market. During the year, we started DEVOTE, a Phase 2/3 study to determine whether a higher dose of nusinersen could provide even greater effi cacy. We also began RESPOND, a Phase 4 study evaluating the benefi t of nusinersen in patients treated with the gene therapy Zolgensma® who display a suboptimal clinical response to Zolgensma. Biosimilars Our biosimilars business grew in both revenue and the number of patients on therapy through year end. The business generated $796 million in full-year revenue, with approximately 240,000 patients relying on our leading portfolio of anti-TNF biosimilars. And through the end of 2020, we have now shipped more than 19 million doses to patients in 30 European countries. Our product differentiation, ongoing commitment to leading science and customer focus enabled our biosimilars business to generate an estimated savings of approximately €2.4 billion for healthcare systems across Europe in 2020. We believe that the foundation of our biosimilars business is robust and that there is more growth opportunity possible through commercializing additional biosimilar products. We notably made progress in ophthalmology, where we have commercialization rights for two potential biosimilar products from Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Samsung Bioepis): – SB11, a proposed ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS® – SB15, a proposed afl ibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA® SB11 is under regulatory review in the U.S. and in the EU. In June 2020, a Phase 3 study was initiated to compare SB15 and the reference product (EYLEA). Global sales of both reference products were more than $11 billion 1 in 2020. The Promise of Our Pipeline We pride ourselves on not being afraid to go where others will not in order to achieve our mission to pioneer in neuroscience in order to transform lives. We know that the opportunity to address the unmet need is tremendous, and our determination has allowed us to advance breakthrough science. In 2020, we made significant strides in diversifying and building a multi-franchise portfolio, propelled by our internal research efforts and by a number of licensing deals and collaborations. We now have 33 clinical programs, many of which were added in the last three years. We believe our pipeline represents one of our most significant value-creation opportunities, spanning a matrix of disease areas and modalities. Alzheimer’s Disease Worldwide approximately 50 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, presenting a significant burden on patients, caregivers and society at large. Alzheimer's disease remains one of the top-10 causes of death in the U.S., affecting about 1 in 10 people over the age of 65. Projections suggest that, over the next 30 years, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s disease will triple. With such a grim reality facing Alzheimer’s disease patients, Biogen has developed a pipeline of potential therapeutics that could slow disease progression. Aducanumab is our most advanced investigational asset. Preparing and filing the complex data packages supporting potential regulatory approval of aducanumab in the U.S., the EU and Japan were among our proudest moments in 2020. We are committed to working with the FDA as it completes its review of our application, and we continue to stand behind our clinical data. We believe our results support approval; the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for aducanumab is expected on June 7, 2021. In preparation for the potential launch, we have continued to evaluate a wide spectrum of system readiness factors. We believe there are several hundred sites in the U.S. that are ready to start treating patients with aducanumab, if approved. Another key component of our Alzheimer’s franchise is BAN2401, which is an anti-amyloid beta antibody also being developed in collaboration with Eisai. BAN2401 is currently in the pivotal Phase 3 Clarity AD study examining patients with symptomatic early Alzheimer’s disease. In 2020, the AHEAD 3-45 Study of BAN2401 was initiated to focus on individuals with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease who have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains. This study is evaluating whether early administration of BAN2401 can potentially prevent cognitive decline in the earliest stages of the disease. We are encouraged by our new global collaboration with Sangamo that leverages its zinc finger protein technology to modulate the expression of key genes involved in neurological diseases. Our aim is to develop gene regulation therapies for Alzheimer’s disease and more. We also made progress on a number of other molecules in our early clinical and preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and dementia portfolio. Notably, we announced positive Phase 1 data for BIIB080 (anti-tau ASO), which may reduce production of the tau protein and its accumulation in brain cells, and which we believe may have the potential to slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease. At the start of 2021, we announced a collaboration with Apple with the aim to develop digital biomarkers for cognitive health. A new virtual research study that we expect to begin during the second half of 2021 will leverage the technology of the Apple Watch and iPhone to develop digital biomarkers that could help a person monitor their cognitive health and screen for early stages of cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment. Neuropsychiatry In 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Sage that brought us a late-stage asset in depression that could address a significant unmet need. In the U.S. alone, 17 million people suffer from depression. Depression also is a common co-morbidity of multiple neurological disorders in our therapeutic portfolio. Despite its common occurrence, 50% of patients with major depressive disorder experience no relief from existing medications. Through our collaboration with Sage, we will jointly develop and commercialize zuranolone (BIIB125) for the potential treatment of major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. Zuranolone is being evaluated as a potential first-in-class, two-week, oncedaily oral therapy currently in multiple Phase 3 studies. Zuranolone may also have potential in other psychiatric disorders including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar depression and generalized anxiety disorder. ALS ALS is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease with significant unmet medical need. People with ALS may experience a gradual weakening of muscles, causing them to lose their strength and ability to speak, move and eventually breathe. To date, no treatment has offered patients an option to fully mitigate the inevitable and devastating effects of this disease. Leading our ALS portfolio is tofersen (BIIB067), which is currently being investigated in the Phase 3 VALOR study of SOD1 ALS, a subtype of familial ALS. In 2020, we also dosed our first patient in the Phase 1 study of BIIB105 (ataxin-2 ASO)2, which has the potential to slow disease progression for the broad ALS population. Lupus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems and is unpredictable in disease severity, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission. A hallmark of SLE is the production of autoantibodies to a variety of nuclear antigens that account for some of the pathological manifestations and ultimately, organ damage. In August 2020, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study of dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L). This study, developed in collaboration with UCB Pharma S.A., targets patients with active SLE despite being treated by standard of care therapies. We also presented positive results from the Phase 2 LILAC study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2) in individuals with lupus. Ophthalmology Adding to our work with investigational ophthalmological biosimilars, we are investigating the use of gene therapies to combat inherited retinal diseases. This includes BIIB111 (timrepigene emparvovec) for choroideremia, a condition of progressive vision loss, and BIIB112 (cotoretigene toliparvovec) for another vision loss disorder known as X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Currently, neither disease has an approved treatment, and both lead to progressive vision loss and potential blindness by mid-life. Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Parkinson’s disease, the second-most common among neurodegenerative illnesses, is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that causes nerve cell damage associated with tremors, stiffness and difficulty with balance and coordination. Despite having discontinued BIIB054 (cinpanemab) following unsuccessful Phase 2 results, Biogen remains committed to advancing treatments for movement disorders. We believe two collaborations position us to lead in addressing these disorders. First, we are working with Denali to co-develop and co-commercialize BIIB122 (DNL151), a small molecule inhibitor of leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) for Parkinson’s disease. Second, we entered into a collaboration with Sage for joint development and commercialization of BIIB124 (SAGE-324), a Phase 2 asset for essential tremor with potential in other neurological conditions such as epilepsy. Environment, Social and Governance Leadership We are working to change lives not just through our science, but through our actions on climate and health as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. Our longstanding leadership in corporate responsibility is built upon transparent and clear disclosure of our policies and performance across environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. As part of our commitment to these critical issues, we have tied a portion of our employees' and executive officers’ 2021 compensation to advancing our ESG strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a clear reminder of just how interrelated health, climate and equity are, and events throughout the year highlighted dramatic disparities that exist on each of these fronts. We took further action in 2020 that underscores our belief that the most successful corporations are those that consider a broad array of stakeholder needs in operating their businesses. We embarked on ambitious goals to augment diversity among our leadership. We also initiated a program to eliminate fossil fuels across our footprint – something we believe will help us realize long-term operational savings. In addition, we continued to build on our priorities for health equity and access, collaborating with a range of stakeholders to promote this shared goal. For example, SPINRAZA is approved in more than 50 countries, including low- and middle-income countries, and our policy to promote access for SPINRAZA will help inform our approach to our broader portfolio of therapies. We have long been recognized for our corporate responsibility leadership. In 2020, we were named the #1 biotechnology company on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index – for an industry-record fifth time. Our corporate responsibility reporting meets multiple guidelines set by organizations at the forefront of ESG disclosures. We are proud of these achievements, but we know there is more to be done. We encourage you to read our Year in review: Our Commitment to Corporate responsibility report for more detail. Climate, Health and Equity The paradox of the pharma and biotech industries is that we cannot truly lead in human health without mitigating our operational impact on the environment. We believe it is imperative for Biogen to make the fight against climate change part of our long-term strategy and investment in our future. In September 2020, we launched Healthy Climate, Healthy Lives, a $250 million, 20-year initiative to eliminate fossil fuels across our operations by 2040 and improve public health. We are the first Fortune 500 company to make such a bold commitment, which goes far beyond net zero. Collaborations related to this effort, including with MIT and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, aim to advance the science around how fossil fuel-related air pollution may impact brain health, and will help under-resourced healthcare centers prepare for climate risks and improve health outcomes for the vulnerable populations they serve. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion We believe that diversity drives innovation and that different backgrounds, cultures and perspectives make us stronger as an organization. Biogen took actions in 2020 to further reinforce our view that prejudice, racism and intolerance are unacceptable. After holding several listening sessions throughout the organization, we introduced an enhanced Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) strategy that outlines actionable steps to deepen our commitment from an already strong foundation. We aim to increase diversity 3 in U.S. manager positions and above by 30% by the end of 2021 – and, globally, to increase women in director-andhigher positions by the same percentage and in the same timeframe. To transparently report our progress, we have publicly disclosed our EEO-1 (Equal Employment Opportunity) data on our website and shared the results of a global pay equity analysis with our employees. We are intent on improving health outcomes for underserved and underrepresented patients. We presented research at MSVirtual2020, the eighth joint meeting of ACTRIMS-ECTRIMS, that showed that ethnic and racial disparities exist related to occupation, income status, MS-related disability and type of treatment used. Furthermore, Biogen is committed to increasing the diversity of our clinical trials to improve minority representation over time. For example, we are collaborating with Tufts University, considering both study design and patient recruitment. Finally, economic empowerment is a critical aspect of our work in addressing systemic racism and inequity. We deposited $10 million with OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in America, to support its focus on Black economic empowerment. In addition, we are continuing our efforts to expand sourcing with minority-owned businesses. Looking Ahead Undeniably, 2020 was a challenging year. But resilience matters, as does a commitment to execution. We are proud that we deepened our pipeline, broadened our global footprint and delivered strong operating results. We believe we are well positioned to build on our strong record of execution, going beyond our current core businesses in an acceleration of our multi-franchise portfolio strategy. As we explore promising therapies that could benefi t patients, we are expanding the defi nition of what is possible – while aiming to address signifi cant unmet needs. I am looking forward to our many expected readouts on the horizon in 2021 as well as upcoming regulatory decisions. We also aim to be at the forefront of neurotechnology. We anticipate that the rapid pace of innovation in digital health and data sciences can be harnessed to enhance our patient services and engagement. We believe this will allow us to have a more holistic approach to detecting and managing neurological diseases. While we believe 2021 will be a reset year for the company fi nancially, we also believe it has the potential to be transformative for Biogen. We are confi dent in our ability to meet the needs of patients who look to us for therapeutic options, to deliver results for our stockholders – and to expand the defi nition of what is possible in neuroscience. We remain driven by a shared purpose in everything we do at Biogen: advancing science for the benefi t of humanity. Together, we are undertaking a deeply human mission with profound implications for the millions of people awaiting life-changing therapies. The vision is for a healthier, more sustainable and equitable world. Biogen has been able to execute against this vision due to my extraordinary colleagues, the trust of our stockholders and deep relationships with our stakeholders. I am grateful to all who have been part of this journey. If 2020 was a year that required resilience and courage, I believe that 2021 will be a year of transformation – one that has the potential to bring great hope to patients worldwide.\n",

            "The first year of our new company was truly a remarkable time in BMS history. I am proud of the significant accomplishments we made in the face of great adversity and change during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created a leading biopharma company, a diversified company with leading medicines across oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular. One with a broad and deep pipeline, and the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation. And one where the best people in the industry are committed to our mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines to patients who need them.\n",
            "\n",
            "We worked hard to deliver on our mission by maintaining an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients, launching new products and continuing to conduct clinical trials where possible, while navigating the challenges of a worldwide pandemic. We did not lose sight of the patients still waiting for answers, as we added new potential medicines to our portfolio and drove scientific discoveries to fuel the renewal of our portfolio well into the future. And we did all of this while building our new company and shaping a new culture based on our shared values and focus on patients. After an unprecedented year of progress amid challenges, we have built the company we set out to create. And yet there is more to do for patients who are waiting.\n",
            "\n",
            "Patients Are Our North Star In 2020, our single vision–to transform patients’ lives through science–guided our teams around the world as we delivered our medicines to patients. Our belief in the power of science to address the most challenging diseases of our time pushed us to strive for innovative solutions. We brought innovative treatment options to patients with the launch of new therapies–including Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt), Onureg (azacitidine) and Zeposia (ozanimod). We added five new indications to our immunooncology portfolio, including four for our dual immunotherapy treatment, Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab). Opdivo-based treatments are helping improve outcomes as first-line treatment for lung cancer patients and showing promise in the adjuvant treatment setting, providing new and earlier treatment options to cancer patients. We continued to advance our late-stage pipeline with positive top-line results in eight pivotal trials on potential new therapies–truly remarkable progress. One such therapy is deucravacitinib, an oral selective tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, being studied across multiple immune-mediated diseases. Pioneered by our own scientists, deucravacitinib demonstrates the innovative approach our scientists take to meeting unmet medical needs. We were very pleased to receive positive Phase 3 study results for deucravacitinib as a potential new treatment option for people living with psoriasis. We continue to investigate additional indications and welcomed results of a second Phase 3 trial in psoriasis this year. In 2020, our hematology franchise continued to grow with the launch of Reblozyl and Onureg. We made great progress in advancing our work in cell therapy, which allows us to potentially redefine the future of personalized medicine, with an advanced cell therapy program and a growing early-stage pipeline that expands across cell and gene therapy targets and technologies. In February of 2021, Breyanzi (liso-cel) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our ide-cel application progressed towards potential approval in the U.S. and E.U. Each are differentiated therapies for hard-to-treat blood diseases. We strengthened our cardiovascular (CV) franchise with the acquisition of MyoKardia, a specialized late-stage CV company. Through MyoKardia, we gained mavacamten, a potential first-in-class therapy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a chronic heart disease with high morbidity and patient impact. Mavacamten continues a long legacy of cardiovascular leadership at BMS, following Eliquis, our novel oral anticoagulant that delivered strong performance in 2020, bringing significant benefit to even more patients. Despite challenges from a global pandemic, our passionate manufacturing and supply teams applied innovative thinking across the globe to meet the needs of patients. They secured our supply chain, organized alternative transportation routes and were able to deliver a continuous supply of medicines. The teams displayed great urgency to ensure launches were executed on time and further strengthened capabilities needed to support the manufacturing of cell therapies. Ensuring access to our products is essential. In 2020, we continued to work with governments and policymakers to advance policies that support and reward investments in the discovery and development of life-saving medicines, while thoughtfully approaching the pricing of our medicines to ensure patient access. In the U.S., we expanded our existing patient support programs to help eligible individuals who lost their jobs and health insurance during the pandemic by offering access to our medicines for free.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Business of Breakthroughs Our focus on unmet needs in cancer, blood diseases, autoimmune and heart diseases comes during a remarkable time when unprecedented scientific discoveries are advancing new treatments as never before in human history. We are advancing our rich mid- to late-stage pipeline across therapeutic areas including assets like Factor XIa inhibitor for thrombosis, cendakimab for eosinophilic esophagitis and CELMoDs for multiple myeloma. Our Research & Early Development teams are building a robust early pipeline across multiple platforms with more than 50 early-stage assets. We expect more than 20 experimental assets to progress through proof of concept in the next three years. At the same time, we continue to build a broad network of biopharma partners to source external innovation. Last year, this included exciting collaborations with DragonFly, insitro, Repare and many more. COVID-19 Pandemic Response 2020 was like no other year. With COVID-19 quickly affecting the world, we focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our workforce, ensuring the continued supply of medicines to our patients and driving relief efforts across the globe. We expanded our existing patient support programs to help eligible patients in the U.S. who lost their health insurance due to the pandemic. Our COVID-19 response and recovery efforts are based on our key priorities to maintain the supply of medicines to patients, protect the health and safety of our workforce, advance our pipeline and assist relief efforts across the globe. Our teams worked with urgency to take all necessary actions to promote public health and continued to carry out our mission of providing life-saving medicines to the patients who depend on us (see page 8 for details). Living Our Values The pivot to remote working for the majority of our workforce was enabled by our supportive culture built on our core values of passion, innovation, urgency, accountability, inclusion and integrity. We benefit from the diversity of our colleagues and strive to foster an environment that is equitable and inclusive. At our core is the belief that the priceless ingredient of every product is the integrity of its maker.\n",
            "\n",
            "The global pandemic and social unrest of 2020 have brought us to a critical inflection point–and businesses who act with purpose will have impact beyond this moment and create lasting change. As the events of 2020 unfolded, our company and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation took bold steps to accelerate and expand health equity and diversity and inclusion efforts. The commitments are aimed at accelerating clinical trial diversity, improving disease awareness in underserved communities, investing in diverse communities and increasing the diversity of the company’s workforce. We then went one step further in December, announcing strengthened environmental sustainability goals through 2040 that build upon those initial commitments. The company has committed to purchase 100 percent of the electricity it uses from renewable sources by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2040 with targets of equitable water use, zero waste to landfill and 100 percent electric vehicles in our fleet. Positioned for the Future Our accomplishments in 2020 reflect our continued progress towards our vision of transforming patients’ lives through science. With strong development and commercial capabilities and a deep and broad pipeline, we are well positioned for growth and the renewal of our portfolio through the end of the decade. We have the most talented people in the industry who show up for work every day dedicated to our mission of discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines to help patients prevail over serious diseases. I am proud of how our teams have collaborated during the pandemic in a virtual environment, building a sense of belonging and connection. We stand ready to bring our workforce back together–at the appropriate time and with the appropriate precautions. The BMS community feels great pride and celebrates each time we see a patient benefit from one of our medicines. But we know how many patients are still waiting for options– this is what motivates us and keeps us focused on the search for the next innovation. \n",

            "Dear Fellow Stockholder: It is my pleasure to invite you to attend Baxter’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 3, 2022, at 9 a.m., Central Daylight Time. The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement will serve as your guide to the business to be conducted. In 2021, Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company) celebrated 90 years of advancing its Mission to Save and Sustain Lives. Sadly, this remarkable milestone unfolded against the backdrop of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic, which has been a constant reminder of both the urgency of our Mission and the depth of our commitment. Baxter’s portfolio of medically essential products has kept us squarely on the front lines of this global public health crisis from the start. Beginning in 2021, we have also played a vital role in the manufacture of vaccines through our BioPharma Solutions manufacturing business. I am so proud of our colleagues worldwide who continue working tirelessly to serve our stakeholders in the face of new variants and an ever-shifting pandemic trajectory. Together we salute the caregivers who are combating this pandemic daily. Baxter’s years-long, enterprise-wide transformation – powered by increased innovation, an ongoing focus on patient safety and quality, enhanced operational effectiveness and disciplined capital allocation – has given us a strong foundation from which to manage through challenges like the ongoing pandemic while simultaneously embracing our opportunities to expand our impact and accelerate performance. In late 2021, we took the next leap forward in our transformation through our acquisition of Hillrom Holdings, Inc. (Hillrom). This combination of two recognized medical technology leaders does more than extend our already diverse healthcare portfolio; it unlocks new potential for innovation in connected care spanning our united product lines. That means new possibilities to spark clinical insights, enhance patient outcomes and increase workflow efficiencies – and generate greater value for the patients, clinicians, employees, communities and stockholders who rely on us. This is the largest acquisition in Baxter’s history, creating remarkable opportunities for growth across our global footprint as well as anticipated synergies driving meaningful cost reduction and margin expansion. Our organization is energized by the promise of this combination and I am fully committed to personally overseeing the successful integration of our organizations – a process that is already well underway. Also providing critical leadership is Giuseppe Accogli, who was recently named our executive vice president and chief operating officer (COO). Giuseppe is a 14-year Baxter veteran, experienced across an array of senior management positions. As COO, his top priorities include advancing a rapid, smooth integration and building upon the opportunities presented by this acquisition. Our diverse portfolio of essential products, global reach, passion to innovate and enhanced operational efficiency continue to fuel our performance and resilience. In 2021, Baxter drove year-over-year reported and constant currency growth in global sales across all of its businesses and geographies. We increased our dividend rate by approximately 14% and returned approximately $1.1 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Like our peers across countless industries, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and the rising cost of raw materials, commodities, components, fuel and shipping. As always, our response is driven foremost by our Mission and colleagues from across our operations are working diligently to ensure steady access to the lifesaving products used by patients and clinicians globally. Both our Mission and dedication to making a meaningful difference compel us to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues touching the lives of our patients, employees and myriad of communities we serve. These efforts are bolstered by our emphasis on good governance, ethics and compliance, inclusion and diversity and numerous other factors that define our impact as a leading corporate citizen. In 2021, Baxter introduced its 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment, comprising ten goals for prioritized action over the next decade and beyond across three key pillars: Empower our Patients, Protect our Planet and Champion our People and Communities. You can find more details in the “Corporate Responsibility” section of the proxy statement and in the Corporate Responsibility section of www.baxter.com. Our focus on sound corporate governance continues to be realized through the composition and practices of our Board of Directors (the Board). The Board maintained its outreach and engagement with Baxter investors throughout 2021, which is vital to helping set our priorities and trajectory. As part of our steady emphasis on Board refreshment, we were privileged to welcome two new Board members in 2021: David S. Wilkes, M.D., former dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine, who joined us in February; and Nancy M. Schlichting, retired president and chief executive officer of Henry Ford Health System, who joined us in December in conjunction with the closing of the Hillrom acquisition. We also offer our appreciation to two Board members departing this May: John D. Forsyth, who has served since 2003; and Thomas T. Stallkamp, who joined us in 2000 and served as lead director between May 2014 and February 2021. They have my deepest thanks for their longtime service and commitment to Baxter’s Mission. As part of our COVID-19 precautions, the Annual Meeting of Stockholders will once again be held by means of remote communications. We hope that you are able to join us to discuss our 2021 results and learn more about our strategic priorities and trajectory for 2022 and beyond. Please review the information on attendance provided on p. 92 of the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement. Details of the business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting are included in the proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully. Your vote is very important to us and I urge you to vote your shares as promptly as possible. You may vote your shares by Internet or by telephone. If you received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, you may sign, date and return the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. You will be able to submit questions in advance of and during the Annual Meeting. It is the greatest honor of my career to serve as Baxter’s leader and, with the acquisition of Hillrom, to set forth on the next chapter of this company’s remarkable story. As always, our success is due entirely to the hard work and dedication of our 60,000 colleagues globally, a proudly diverse team united in a single Mission: Save and Sustain Lives. On behalf of the Board, management team and employees, thank you for your continued confidence and support as we advance this Mission for patients globally. We look forward to your participation in this year’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders. \n",

            "As I look back on the last 18 months, the sheer volume of change has been remarkable, and the resilience that our employees, customers and communities have shown gives me optimism about the road ahead. The pandemic has illuminated to me the vital role our company plays in the global healthcare system. I’ve said before that what we do matters, and it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients and their communities around the world.\n",

            "Our response to COVID-19 \n",
            "\n",
            "As the pandemic began, our company, along with so many others, adapted with urgency. We kept all our facilities open and operating with new safety protocols, and our essential employees embodied our Company values of being accountable and mission-driven in their response to the unprecedented needs of the healthcare system. We focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, so they could deliver critical products and services to our customers. \n",
            "\n",
            "We partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a network administrator to enable retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. Collectively to date, our enrolled network of 3,500- plus community pharmacy customers who participate in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program have administered more than 3.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Nearly 2,000 of our participating pharmacies serve vulnerable populations. We were awarded a Strategic National Stockpile contract to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of personal protective equipment (PPE). \n",
            "\n",
            "We evaluated our entire supply chain following disruptions after the onset of the pandemic in early 2020. We diversified our sourcing to limit geographic concentrations and invested in additional self-manufacturing capabilities including increases in annual production of safety needles and syringes, isolation gowns, and surgical and procedure masks in our own North American facilities. We expanded capacity for our kitting operations so we can carry more inventory for customers. Also, we seized opportunities to innovate, by piloting technology solutions to incorporate robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution processes. \n",

            "Our fiscal 2021 financial performance \n",
            "\n",
            "We had a strong start to FY21, which was overshadowed by disappointing fourth quarter results. This was largely due to a $197 million inventory reserve adjustment driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products. To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer than normal supply chains. \n",
            "\n",
            "Although I am not satisfied with our full year performance, we did see growth in both segments, excluding the impact of COVID-19. As we move into FY22 and as the pandemic’s effects on our business lessen, this underlying growth gives me confidence in our strategy. \n",
            "\n",
            "In FY21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year, and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew non-GAAP EPS. We continued to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow, returned approximately $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strengthened our balance sheet by paying down approximately $550 million of debt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout the past year, I’ve been taking action to drive performance, and will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis™ business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing™ agreement, extended our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with CVS Health™, and identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities. \n",
            "\n",
            "At my direction, our management team is continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve. With the actions we’ve taken to date and our plans for FY22, I feel confident in our strategy, and am encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moving forward \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas — Specialty Solutions, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions, Medical Services and Outcomes™ — and expect these businesses to collectively realize double-digit growth in FY22. And across our business, we’re enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities and digitization, improve the customer experience, and drive productivity. \n",
            "\n",
            "In our Pharmaceutical segment, we’re nearing the end of a multi-year project, accompanied by significant investment spending, to modernize our technology infrastructure which will simplify our processes, improve data insights, and enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the Medical segment, we have been taking quick, decisive action throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our Medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into FY22. We’ve recently restructured our organization to establish clearer lines of ownership and accountability and made management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. Medical Products and Distribution, as well as a single leader to manage International. With the divestiture of Cordis™, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint — and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit — so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth. \n",
            "\n",
            "With respect to the enterprise, I’m aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY22, I plan to launch initiatives that we expect to deliver an additional $250 million in savings by FY23. \n",
            "\n",
            "I will continue to take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment, with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. \n",
            "\n",
            "Opioid update \n",
            "\n",
            "In July, we announced that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. As I write this letter, we have determined that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, and each participating state will offer its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends January 2, 2022. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities and, depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. \n",
            "\n",
            "This is an important step forward for our company. As we’ve consistently said, we remain committed to being a part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic and believe the settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders.\n",
            "\n",
            "In closing \n",
            "\n",
            "In January, we recognized our 50th anniversary. From our start as a grocery distributor, we’ve evolved and grown into the company we are today — a distributor of pharmaceuticals, a global manufacturer and distributor of medical and laboratory products, and a provider of technology-enabled performance and data solutions for healthcare facilities. While the events of the last year have introduced significant, rapid changes for our business and the world we live in, over 50 years we’ve learned that change is the only constant. We’ve adapted and pivoted at every step, using grit and determination to turn our challenges into opportunities. \n",
            "\n",

            "When I wrote to you one year ago, it was still early days for the COVID-19 pandemic that has since resulted in more than 120 million infections and 2.6 million deaths worldwide. Indeed, 2020 proved to be a year like no other, with worldwide economic disruption and social turmoil caused by the greatest public health crisis in more than a century. While the end of the pandemic may not yet be near, we should feel confident today that we at least have reached the beginning of the end. Incredible feats of biotechnology have made that possible in a remarkably brief period of time. A belief in the potential of biotechnology inspired Amgen’s founders to create our company more than 40 years ago. We are even more convinced today about the potential for biotechnology to make a positive difference in the world than they were then. Under very trying circumstances, Amgen fulfilled many important objectives over the past year. With so many families and companies struggling with the effects of the pandemic, this is not a time to celebrate our performance. Nonetheless I want to acknowledge the resilience of our staff and their dedication to our mission to serve patients. We were strong heading into the pandemic and, thanks to them, we expect to emerge from it even stronger. \n",

            "Throughout 2020, and still today, we have kept our focus on a few priorities. Foremost among these is the health and safety of our employees around the world. Roughly three-quarters of our staff continue to work from home, and we have taken comprehensive measures to ensure the safety of those working on-site in our manufacturing plants and laboratories. We have also offered paid leave to medically-trained staff members who wish to volunteer full time to assist in COVID-19 relief efforts. In a poll of our staff, more than 90% of our people responded that they are satisfied with how the company has been supporting them during this challenging time.

Finally, Amgen is contributing to the health of the communities where we live and work. In March 2020, Amgen and the Amgen Foundation pledged $12.5 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts around the world. Some of these funds have gone to nonproft organizations like Direct Relief that do their work on a global scale. The vast majority of our donations, however, have been made at the local level—to food banks, ambulance squads, and senior care facilities. Additionally, the Amgen Foundation has been working to extend the impact of two virtual science education platforms, Khan Academy and LabXchange. These platforms— free to everyone—have become increasingly important for the millions of children staying home from school. LabXchange, for example, was launched in January 2020 and has already reached six million users interested in conducting virtual lab experiments.

            "DELIVERING RESULTS The people of Amgen rose to the challenge of COVID-19 in 2020 and generated impressive results. I told you a year ago that we expected revenue growth in 2020. Despite an incredibly challenging and unpredictable year, total revenues increased 9% to a record $25.4 billion, driven by a number of factors: • We delivered year-over-year, double-digit growth for many of our newer innovative medicines, including our cholesterol treatment Repatha® (+34%), our migraine therapy Aimovig® (+24%), and our osteoporosis medicine EVENITY® (+85%). We have been able to generate this strong growth overall through volume gains, rather than price increases—important in light of intense budget pressures facing healthcare systems around the world. • We successfully integrated Otezla®, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation. Acquired by Amgen in November 2019, Otezla® generated sales of $2.2 billion in 2020, and we believe it will be a strong growth driver for us in the coming years. We grew annual sales of our biosimilars to $1.7 billion. Four Amgen biosimilars are now available to patients around the world. The most recent addition to our portfolio is RIABNI™, approved in the U.S. in December 2020 as a biosimilar to the cancer medicine Rituxan®. 3 We have an additional three biosimilars in Phase 3 development. • We increased our sales by 10% outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, with our revenues in the Asia-Pacific region exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Our non-GAAP earnings per share rose 12% in 2020 to a record $16.60,4 with our non-GAAP operating margin increasing 0.7 percentage points to 50.9%,4 among the highest in our industry. Both of these measures reflect that we are managing our business efficiently and driving continuous productivity gains. Research and development investments are inherently long term. We invested $4.2 billion in research and development in 2020—and approximately $19 billion over the past five years—to advance potential medicines at all stages of our pipeline and to strengthen our early research capabilities, which I will discuss below. Although total shareholder return declined a modest 2% in 2020, it has increased by 44%, 63%, and 425% over the past three, five, and ten years, respectively, exceeding our peer group in each of these longer-term time periods. We returned in excess of $7 billion to shareholders in 2020 through dividends and share repurchases. As the chart on page 4 illustrates, we have increased our dividend nearly sixfold since 2011, with an additional 10% increase for the frst and second quarters of 2021 versus the same periods in 2020. FOCUSING ON 2021 AND BEYOND By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for Amgen, and our ability to deliver in the most trying of circumstances gives us confidence for the future. The pandemic has made it clear that the world needs more innovation, not less, and we at Amgen are determined to provide it. We have more than 20 marketed medicines in our portfolio that treat some of the world’s most serious, widespread, and costly diseases. We believe that many of these products can benefit significantly more patients around the world than they do today. In 2020, for example, we fled for approval of our migraine prevention treatment Aimovig® in Japan, where eight million people live with this often incapacitating disease. This marked the first regulatory fling for Amgen in Japan since we assumed full ownership of our long-standing collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc. in April 2020. In China, our cancer medicines are reaching more patients thanks to a strategic collaboration initiated in January 2020 with BeiGene, Ltd., a leading cancer biotechnology company in that market. As part of our collaboration, we have invested $3.35 billion to establish an ownership stake in BeiGene of approximately 20%. Outside of this collaboration, Amgen in 2020 launched Prolia® in China, where one in three women over the age of 50 is affected by osteoporosis. Otezla® is another product with strong growth potential globally, having been launched in only about 40 of the 55 countries where it is approved. Additionally, in February 2021, we fled Otezla® for a new indication in the U.S., which would significantly expand the number of patients who could potentially benefit from this medicine. Looking forward, we are especially excited about two potential new product candidates—sotorasib for non-small cell lung cancer and tezepelumab for severe asthma—both of which have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Sotorasib represents the culmination of a 40-year quest to treat non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors harboring the KRASG12C mutation. This mutation is found in approximately 13% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, which is the most common form of lung cancer. The KRASG12C protein was long considered an “undruggable” target. Amgen scientists were the first to identify a previously hidden crevice on the surface of the KRASG12C protein. Our scientists then engineered a molecule—sotorasib— that could attach to the protein. We have moved sotorasib forward with unprecedented speed, fling it for approval in the U.S. and the European Union just 28 months after the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial—making it among the fastest drug development programs in history. What’s especially remarkable is that during the last 10 of these 28 months, everyone involved with this program—Amgen staff, clinical trial investigators, and, of course, patients— had to deal with the complications presented by the pandemic. In the U.S., sotorasib has received Priority Review designation from the FDA and is being evaluated under the agency’s Real Time Oncology Review program, which aims to create a more efficient review process so that important new treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Additionally, as of March 1, we have fled sotorasib for approval as a nonsmall cell lung cancer treatment in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the UK. We are also studying sotorasib in combination with other cancer therapies and in other solid tumor types. We expect data from several of these studies to become available during 2021. Tezepelumab is our investigational medicine for severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Unlike existing treatments, tezepelumab targets a protein that sits at the top of multiple infammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma. The prevalence of severe asthma is expected to grow over time as millions of people around the world move from rural to urban areas, where the air quality is typically poorer. We expect to submit tezepelumab for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe in the first half of this year. We are also exploring it as a potential treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sotorasib and tezepelumab represent the very best of Amgen—potential first-in-class medicines that treat serious diseases for which there are very few good options otherwise available for patients. We believe both have the potential to be important products for Amgen for many years to come. Behind our late-stage pipeline assets are several potential new medicines now in Phase 2 development for the treatment of atherosclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and celiac disease.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among the many Amgen molecules in Phase 1 development, AMG 160 and AMG 757 have each shown encouraging early data suggesting effectiveness against prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer, respectively. Both are in a class of medicines known as bispecific T-cell engagers, or BiTE® molecules, which are designed to engage a patient’s own immune cells to target and destroy tumor cells. In 2020, we advanced an additional eight investigational therapies into Phase 1 clinical studies—one more than in 2019, which is remarkable given the challenges of COVID-19. Seven of the eight represent “firsts,” either for Amgen or the entire industry. To keep our pipeline full of promising new treatments over the long term, we continue to invest in building a set of differentiated early research capabilities. In human genetics, for example, we are adding information from as many as one million volunteers in the U.S. and the UK. This will augment the data we already have on 1.5 million individuals from around the world, many of whom live in Iceland, home to deCODE Genetics. In what is shaping up to be the world’s largest proteomics experiment, we are measuring the relative levels of some 5,000 difficult-to-detect proteins in the blood of 37,000 Icelanders who have cardiovascular disease and whose genomes have been sequenced. We are excited about the insights being generated from this groundbreaking work, which we expect will improve our ability to predict who is at risk for disease and to develop therapies to keep them healthy. Amgen is also pioneering new types of molecules that work through a principle we call “induced proximity.” I mentioned earlier that the KRASG12C protein found in many patients with non-small cell lung cancer was an elusive target for decades due to the difficulty of getting a drug to bind to its surface. This is a common problem, with an estimated 85% of human proteins falling into this “undruggable” category. To overcome this challenge, we are now developing drugs that can form connections between two or more proteins. Instead of operating on their own—as traditional medicines do—these drugs induce proximity between targeted proteins, clearing the way for powerful biological mechanisms to help get the job done. This opens up vast new possibilities to tackle diseases that currently have few, if any, good treatment options.

            "OPERATING WITH PURPOSE For several years now, businesses have faced increasing expectations of corporate responsibility, and I expect that the pandemic will only accelerate this trend. Our society confronts multiple challenges, and we are working to do our part to address them as effective corporate stewards. Here are just a few examples of what we are doing: • In January 2021, we announced ambitious new environmental goals, including a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions (also known as “carbon neutrality”) by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water used and a 75% reduction in waste disposed.6 These new targets build on the good progress we have made in these three areas since 2007, all coming even as we significantly expanded our business. We are building a more diverse and inclusive culture at Amgen—one in which all of our people feel they belong and can achieve their full potential. We surveyed our staff in 2020 and found that the vast majority believe they “work in an environment that is free from harassment and discrimination” and are “treated with respect and dignity.” While our scores are well above global benchmarks, we know we can do even better. To date, our employees in the U.S. and Canada have completed mandatory unconscious bias training, with the rest of the organization to follow this year. Our employee resource groups—which have always enjoyed strong support at Amgen— increased their membership by 75% collectively in 2020, and these groups increasingly meet together to discuss common areas of interest such as maintaining mental health and well-being during stressful times. • Our minority employees have told us heartbreaking stories about how they are marginalized—and often mistreated—in their personal lives. As a result, the Amgen Foundation, working in partnership with the Amgen Black Employee Network, donated $7.5 million last year to support organizations advancing social justice across the U.S. at the national and local levels. One of these organizations, Strive for College, connects high school students in financial need with free, one-on-one mentoring to help them navigate the college and financial aid application process. Eighty-five percent of these students are minorities, and many will be the first in their families to go to college. • In December 2020, Amgen became a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of more than 40 of the world’s largest, best-known companies that aims collectively to hire one million Black Americans into good-paying jobs over the next ten years, with a specific focus on those without a four-year college degree. We recognize that people of color experience many diseases at higher rates than the general population, while having less access to healthcare and suffering poorer health outcomes. Amgen is working to address these health disparities, in part through efforts to increase the diversity of participants in our clinical trials, which will in turn help us better understand how our medicines will perform in a broad patient population. I want to acknowledge the Amgen Black Employee Network for its leadership on this important issue. We recognize that many patients are unable to afford the medicines they need. In response, the Amgen Safety Net Foundation has provided approximately $6 billion7 of our medicines at no cost over the past five years to qualifying patients. We are also committed to the responsible pricing of our medicines. In fact, 2020 marked the third year in a row in which the average net price of Amgen medicines declined.

We have elevated doing the right thing to priority status for as long as I can remember. Even before the concept of corporate social responsibility or the focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) had specific names, it was how we did business and part of who we are. It is The Aflac Way. The Aflac Way is engrained in our culture, daily operations, and interactions with the communities we serve and in which we live. All things being equal, we believe most people prefer doing business with a company that is also a good corporate citizen. Whether it is being there for our policyholders when they need us most, helping families facing childhood cancer, providing opportunities for our diverse workforce and distribution channels, being mindful of our impact on the environment, or being good stewards of the resources of shareholders, we believe that our approach is not only the right thing to do, but also makes good business sense. As we reflect on 2021, adaptable, purposeful and resilient are three adjectives that first come to mind. I don’t think it’s coincidental that Aflac has achieved success while being purposeful about doing the right thing. In fact, I believe they go hand in hand. I’m proud of what we have accomplished by delivering solid earnings and in terms of our social purpose. I want to emphasize a very important point: although we at Aflac were certainly impacted by the COVID pandemic, we have not remained idle waiting for it to disappear. We have continued to invest strategically in our business and our brand. Through sound risk management, agile planning and acting swiftly, Aflac was well positioned to respond in order to safeguard the health and well-being of our workforce, policyholders and communities in both Japan and the United States. After all, our greatest commitment to our policyholders lies in our promise to be there for them in their time of need. In the face of the ongoing pandemic, in 2021 we reported net earnings per diluted share of $6.39 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.00, excluding the impact of foreign currency.* This latter measure of profitability is one of the principal financial measures used to evaluate management’s performance and allows us to continue fulfilling our purpose as a socially responsible corporation that benefits shareholders and stakeholders alike over the long term. We are continually working on our foundation of sustainable growth, especially related to leveraging these particular strategic areas of focus: • Diverse and productive distribution • Recognized, trusted and powerful brand • Product innovation and customized, high-quality service • Strong capital position marked by stable earnings and strong cash flows • Industry-leading market share and scale in Japan and the U.S. We are pleased to share one remarkable achievement in 2021—our 39th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. We are proud to be able to continue that long track record even amid the backdrop of a global pandemic. The world continues to change in ways that surprise us. But what hasn’t changed is the fact that, pandemic or no pandemic, people still face the same illnesses, accidents, and health conditions every day. We remain committed to being there for them in their time of need. Despite uncertainty, we have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We will continue to build our business and take care of those who depend on us: our policyholders, shareholders, customers, employees, distribution channels and communities in which we operate. Throughout this report, you will read about some of our many achievements in our environmental, social and governance initiatives, as well as Aflac Incorporated’s financial performance. So much has occurred over the last 30-plus years. Through it all, I continue to believe that our compassionate approach and the trust we build with those who depend upon us results in a stronger brand that consumers, employees and all our stakeholders want to associate with. This approach ultimately helps us generate long-term value for shareholders. We hope that you will enjoy what you find on the pages of this report, as well as future updates.\n",

The resiliency and dedication of our 50,000 employees throughout the world allowed us to achieve AbbVie’s record revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as well as a total shareholder return of more than 30 percent. We further invested in science to support our pipeline of promising new therapies, and we gave back to our communities through both our philanthropic efforts and through our patient assistance programs, in which we provided free medicines to over 170,000 patients who were experiencing financial need. I am tremendously proud of the results we achieved, and I want to thank all of the AbbVie employees who made these results possible. Our financial performance was strong. We delivered full year adjusted EPS of $12.70, which represents growth of approximately 20 percent over the prior year, and net revenues of more than $56 billion, an increase of nearly 23 percent over the prior year. Our adjusted investment in research and development was more than $6.5 billion, which represents a nearly 12 percent increase over 2020. We have a proven track record of developing new medicines, with 21 major product or indication approvals since the inception of our company. We anticipate the approval of over a dozen new products or indications in our key therapeutic franchises over the next couple years. Our continuous investment in leading-edge science will fuel our growth in the next decade and will benefit patients with new therapies to treat difficult disease conditions. Additionally, we delivered on our promise to serve the communities where we live and work. In 2021, we supported COVID-19 vaccine clinics in underserved areas to help vaccinate more than 18,000 of the most vulnerable patient populations and donated hundreds of hours of employee time volunteering to support local mass vaccination sites.

These are foundational Abbott traits — characteristics that run throughout our 130-year history and that are carrying us into a future of remarkable new scientific, technological, and human capability. Those traits came to us from Dr. Wallace Abbott himself. So did the purpose that drives us — using medical science to help people live their fullest lives through better health. Another fundamental Abbott characteristic that has been critical to our success — over many decades and especially through the pandemic — is our diversified business model. Never has this long-term strategy been tested more strenuously or proven more valuable. Abbott is uniquely balanced across multiple dimensions, including our business mix, customer and payor types, varying innovation cycles, and geographic footprint. As we’ve long demonstrated, this business model provides us more opportunities to win during good times and makes us more resilient during difficult ones.

            "\n",
            "Clearly, the course of the pandemic was a significant factor in Abbott’s 2021 performance. The introduction of effective vaccines drove testing demand down — then the advent of the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus drove that demand back up, to higher levels than ever before. We’re now producing more than 150 million tests per month, across our global platforms. But as significant — and more so for the long term — was the balanced strength of our underlying businesses. All four of these — Medical Devices, Nutrition, Established Pharmaceuticals, and Diagnostics — delivered strong growth for the year. Central to this was a steady stream of new-product introductions across the company and around the world, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "The first handheld rapid test for concussions\n",
            "\n",
            "Our Neurosphere Virtual Clinic, a technology that allows doctors to remotely program our devices that treat chronic pain and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease\n",
            "\n",
            "New formulations and flavors of our nutritionals Glucerna, Ensure, PediaSure, Pedialyte and Similac, including our new 360 Total Care formula with a blend of five HMO prebiotics\n",
            "\n",
            "Our next-generation TriClip device to repair heart valves\n",
            "\n",
            "Navitor, our latest generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system to treat aortic valve stenosis and the Portico TAVR system for transcatheter aortic valve replacement\n",
            "\n",
            "A number of new medicines, including Brufen Rapid, our fast-acting ibuprofen, and Influvac Tetra, our vaccine for four different strains of influenza in multiple countries\n",
            "\n",
            "New tests across our whole family of Alinity diagnostics systems\n",

            "\n",
            "That’s an extremely productive pipeline under any circumstances, and even more noteworthy given the challenges of this environment. Added to consistently strong execution across our businesses, this helped us to deliver outstanding financial performance. Adjusted earnings per share rose almost 43 percent for the year — exceeding the guidance we set at the beginning of the year — on sales of more than $43 billion, up almost 23 percent over 2020. We returned more than $5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buy-backs. And, in December, we announced a dividend increase of over four percent for 2022, following a 25 percent increase the prior year; this makes for an average dividend increase of more than 15 percent since the beginning of the pandemic. Abbott has now paid dividends for 98 consecutive years and this year we joined the exclusive list of Dividend Kings — the small group of companies that have paid increasing dividends for the last 50 years or more. Over the past decade, Abbott has provided shareholders a total return of approximately 540 percent versus a market return of 360 percent. \n",

            "THE FUTURE \n",
            "\n",
            "The story of Abbott is one of continual invention and reinvention. We follow science and technology in order to lead the industry toward new possibilities and the world toward greater health. The mission of Abbott leaders is to carry that legacy into the future — to ensure that the company’s success is sustained for the long term. This tradition was richly demonstrated by Miles D. White, who stepped down as the Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors in December, concluding his great Abbott career. Miles joined the company in 1984, became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board in 1999, and proceeded to lead the company through a series of strategic transformations, resulting in one of Abbott’s most dynamic and successful eras. His constant focus throughout his tenure was on anticipating the future and shaping the company to meet it. We thank Miles for his leadership, as a result of which the company is better aligned with the future of healthcare than ever before.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, Abbott is at the forefront of one of the defining trends for the next era of health — the convergence of healthcare with digital technology. This is making truly incredible things possible. We’re working today to digitize, decentralize, and democratize healthcare. In other words, we’re using advanced digital technologies to create new capabilities for the people who use our products. We’re expanding the ways and places in which healthcare can be delivered — not only in traditional institutional settings, but wherever the patient is, by helping them connect with their caregivers through our technologies. And we’re putting more power, control, ease, and convenience in the hands of the people who matter most and who have the most at stake — the patients whose lives literally depend on our products. This new power is at the core of the vision we presented in January when we appeared as the first-ever healthcare company to give a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world’s largest and most influential tech event. This distinction recognized our leadership at the cutting edge of healthcare technology. A striking example is Lingo, the new line of biowearables we’re developing based on our world-leading FreeStyle Libre sensing technology, which we announced at CES. This family of sensors is being designed to easily give users more information about the functioning of their bodies — reading factors such as ketones, lactates, glucose, and alcohol levels — to help people not just monitor their health status, but to understand the unique language of their individual bodies, to gain greater control and, potentially, to improve their physical capabilities over time. It’s through this democratization of healthcare — by putting more control in people’s own hands, wherever they are around the world — that we aim to achieve our ambitious 2030 Sustainability Plan goal of helping three billion people every year to achieve better health. Abbott began as one man making better medicines by hand in his own home. By unwaveringly pursuing the same goal ever since — using medical technology to help people live fuller lives — we will soon reach one of every three people on the planet. That’s the power of vision, of innovation, and of commitment. These are the continuous threads that run through this company’s history — an ongoing legacy of service that we are fiercely dedicated to protecting and advancing for many years to come. \n",
